											<div class="poemQuote">
							What oppressed me so much<br>
Was a bit shameful.<br>
Talking of it aloud<br>
Would show neither tact nor prudence.<br>
It might even seem an outrage<br>
Against the health of mankind.
							<div class="poet">"A Poem For the End of the Century" by <span>Czeslaw Milosz</span></div>
						</div>
											<div class="poemQuote">
							But no sooner, the fact is, you bind, as your tact is,<br>
Your head with the vows of untruth,<br>
Than you shine out more charming, and, what's more alarming,<br>
You come forth beloved of our youth.
							<div class="poet">"To Barine" by <span>Roswell Martin Field</span></div>
						</div>
											<div class="poemQuote">
							Among the "Upper Ten" to-day,<br>
It is considered want of tact<br>
To slay one's kith and kin, and may<br>
Be classed as an "unfriendly act."<br>
Oh, yes, of course I know that this<br>
Is merely public prejudice.
							<div class="poet">"The Cat" by <span>Harry Graham</span></div>

											<div class="poemQuote">
							Horatio was a decent guy,<br>
And when she ravished from her heart<br>
A damsite better man than I,<br>
She seemed to me,—well, just a tart:<br>
Her lack of tact I can't explain.<br>
His picture,—is it hung again?
							<div class="poet">"Horatio" by <span>Robert W Service</span></div>

											<div class="poemQuote">
							"Impulsive breeze, the use of force,"<br>
Observed the sun, "a foolish act is,<br>
Perceiving which, you see, of course.<br>
How highly efficacious tact is."<br>
The wondering wind replied, "Good gracious!<br>
You're right about the efficacious."
							<div class="poet">"The Impetuous Breeze And The Diplomatic Sun" by <span>Guy Wetmore Carryl</span></div>

											<div class="poemQuote">
							THE MORAL deals, as morals do,<br>
With tact, and all its virtues boasted,<br>
But still I can't forget, can you,<br>
That wretched man, first chilled, then roasted?<br>
Bronchitis seized him shortly after,<br>
And that's no cause for vulgar laughter.
