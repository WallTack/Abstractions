						Quantum Mechanics as a Simple Generalization of Classical Mechanics
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						The authors were interested thus in discussing, in a not systematical fashion, how to put the equation allowing the obtention of the conventional exponential function in a convenient form.

						On The Construction of Generalized Coherent States for Generalized Harmonic Oscillators
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						However, we can obtain analoguos formulas for a generic [ρn ]q , but we will lose this resemblance to the conventional case; i.e the bosonic C.S.

						On The Construction of Generalized Coherent States for Generalized Harmonic Oscillators
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						This has been impressively illustrated by Brillouin scattering of X-rays : on a THz scale, sound propagates in water with almost the same speed as in ice, more than twice as fast as on the kHz or MHz scale of conventional ultrasonic measurements.

						Structural Relaxation and Mode Coupling in a Simple Liquid: Depolarized Light Scattering in Benzene
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						We note that this is much closer to the viscosity of, say, water at room temperature (about 10−2 Poise) than to the glass transition (which, according to wide-spread convention, occurs at 1013 Poise).
