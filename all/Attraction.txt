									<li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">attraction</span> <span class="exp">The act, power, or property of attracting. Specifically— In physical, the force through which particles of matter are attracted or drawn toward one another; a component acceleration of particles toward one another, according to their distance. Such attraction is a mutual action which in some form all bodies, whether at rest or in motion, exert upon one another. The attractive force with which the atoms of different bodies in certain cases tend to unite, so as to form a new body or bodies, is called chemical affinity; that which binds together the molecules of the same body is called cohesion; those of different bodies, adhesion. Connected with the last-named forces is capillary attraction, by which liquids tend to rise in fine tubes or small interstices of porous bodies. In all the cases mentioned the forces act only through very small distances. When bodies tend to come together from sensible distances, the acceleration being inversely as the square of the distance, and the force proportional to the mass, the attraction is called gravitation, as when the earth attracts and is attracted by a falling body, or attracts and is attracted by the moon, etc.; or magnetism, as when exerted between the unlike poles of a magnet; or electricity, as when dissimilarly electrified bodies attract one another. See capillary, chemical, cohesion, electricity, gravitation, magnetism. The power or act of alluring, winning, or engaging; allurement; enticement: as, the attraction of beauty or eloquence.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">attraction</span> <span class="exp">That which attracts feeling or desire; a charm; an allurement.</span> </li>

						Weak-interaction limits for one-dimensional random polymers

						The method introduced in this paper extends to the situation where self-attraction is added to the polymer.

						Weak-interaction limits for one-dimensional random polymers
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						Traditionally, this regular behavior has been interpreted as a consequence of particular interactions, such as an attractive pairing force in semimagic nuclei and an attractive neutron-proton quadrupole-quadrupole interaction for deformed nuclei. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						How random are random nuclei? Shapes, triangles and kites
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						Note that when m &gt; 1, our class of simply attractive potentials is rather restrictive; each one can be decomposed into a sum of m simply attractive potentials, one in each coordinate direction.

					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						If the Vx,y are increasing on [0, ∞) and for some b &gt; 0 satisfy the condition that Vx,y (mη ) ≤ bVx,y (η ) for all η , then Φ is a perturbed simply attractive potential. (Observe that Ψ{x,y}(ψ) = b Pm i=1 Vx,y (|ψ(x)i−ψ(y )i |) is simply attractive.

						Random Surfaces
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						It is also easy to see that the sum of a perturbed simply attractive potential and any bounded potential is (at least after adding a constant) a perturbed simply attractive potential.

						Random Surfaces
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						Each of these models is the sub ject of a sizable literature, and each has features that make it easier to work with than general simply attractive or perturbed simply attractive potentials.
