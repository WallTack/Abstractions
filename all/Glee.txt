The structure of a glee is seldom truly contrapuntal, but considerable independence of the parts is essential; the former characteristic distinguishes it from the madrigal, the latter from the part-song. The glee is essentially of English origin and cultivation, and its best period was from 1760 to 1830. Synonyms Joy, Joviality, etc. (see hilarity)', exhilaration, jollity, jocularity, sportiveness.</span> </li><li><span class="term">glee</span> <span class="exp">See gley.</span> </li>
