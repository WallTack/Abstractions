The first five words express the fact of unlikeness; difference and distinction apply also to that wherein the unlikeness lies, and discrimination to the act of making or marking a difference, and to the faculty of discerning differences. (See discernment.) Distinction applies also to the eminence conferred on account of difference. Difference is the most general, applying to things small or great, internal or external. Distinction is generally, but not always, external, and generally marks delicate differences: as, the distinction between two words that are almost synonymous. Diversity, by its derivation, is a great or radical difference, equal to going in opposite directions. Dissimilarity is unlikeness, generally in large degree or essential points. Disparity is inequality, generally in rank or age. Disagreement and variance are weak words by their original meaning, but through euphemistic use have come to stand for dissimilarity of opinion of almost any degree, and for the resulting alienation of feeling, or even dissension and strife.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">difference</span> <span class="exp">Dissension, contest, falling out, strife, wrangle, altercation.</span> </li><li><span class="term">difference</span> <span class="exp">To cause a difference or distinction in or between; make different or distinct.</span> </li><li><span class="term">difference</span> <span class="exp">To distinguish; discriminate; note the difference of or between.</span> </li><li><span class="term">difference</span> <span class="exp">In heraldry, to bear with a difference; add a difference to.</span> </li><li><span class="term">difference</span> <span class="exp">In mathematics, to take the difference of (a function); also, to compute the successive differences of the numbers in a table.</span> </li>
