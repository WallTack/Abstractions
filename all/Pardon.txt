These words are often synonymous. Strictly, pardon expresses the act of an official or a superior, remitting all or the remainder of the punishment that belongs to an offense: as, the queen or the governor pardons a convict before the expiration of his sentence. Forgive refers especially to the feelings; it means that one not only resolves to overlook the offense and reestablishes amicable relations with the offender, but gives up all ill feeling against him. See pardon, n.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">pardon</span> <span class="exp">Forgiveness of an offender or of his offense or crime; a passing over without punishment; remission of penalty.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">pardon</span> <span class="exp">In law, a free remission of the legal consequences of guilt or of some part of them; an act of grace proceeding from the power charged with the execution of the laws, which exempts the individual on whom it is bestowed from the punishment the law prescribes for a crime he has committed. Marshall. Mere mitigation of punishment is not pardon. Pardon is sometimes used in the more general sense which includes amnesty. In Great Britain the pardoning of offenses against the crown or the people rests with the crown, except in certain specified cases. Pardon is granted under the great seal or by warrant under the sign manual, countersigned by one of the principal secretaries of state, or by act of Parliament. Offenders against the laws of the United States may be pardoned by the President, except in cases of impeachment. In nearly all the States, persons convicted of crimes under the State laws, except in cases of treason and impeachment, may be pardoned by the governor, the governor and council, or the governor and board of pardons.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">pardon</span> <span class="exp">The deed or warrant by which such remission is declared. Delivery is essential to its validity, and delivery is not complete without acceptance; but in some cases constructive acceptance has been held sufiicient, as where it was delivered to the jailer, the prisoner being ignorant of it.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">pardon</span> <span class="exp">A papal indulgence, or remission of the temporal punishment due to sin, usually for a stated time.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">pardon</span> <span class="exp">Allowance; excuse.</span> </li>

						Based on that information, A recalculates the probability of being pardoned as 1/2, since now only one pardon remains for him and C (the third prisoner) to share! However, he could apply the same argument if the Guard had named C .

										<div class="usage">
						The intuitive explanation is that after learning the Guard’s testimony G(B ) that B will be pardoned, A should revise the probability of the event P (A) (of him being pardoned) by computing P ( uP (A)|G(B )), and the probability evaluation yields in this case 2/3, as expected.

						However, what he indeed calculated was P ( uG(B )|P (A)), assuming effectively that the pardon had been given with equal probabilities to all the pairs possible after Guard’s testimony.

						We begin in the leftmost circle (before pardon), then each of the three pardoned pairs leads us to three next circles, indicating the situation after the pardon.

					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						After Guard’s testimony G(B ), only the two top circles on the right are possible, and their probabilities are in the proportion 2 : 1, the more probable one being the one in which A is pardoned, while he is executed in the other one.

										<div class="usage">
						Because we believe that after being pardoned nobody can be prosecuted again for the same crime, and we do not believe in reincarnation, either, our choice is to use self-loops in the terminal states, yielding a “Russian roulette” model.

					<div class="uAuthor">
						The temporal calculus of conditional objects and conditional events
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						The construction of a correct (TL|TL) representation is a little bit more complicated than the formula P ( uP (A)|G(B )) we have suggested previously, as this requires specifying the actions of the Guard, whose probabilities are affected by the pardon decision.

						So indeed now the answers of the Guard are shorthands for the combinations of the pardon decision and the coin toss outcome.

						Note that, e.g., assuming events A, B and C to be nonexclusive individual pardon decisions of probability 1/3 each, leads to more complicated conditional expression, because a substantial amount of coding effort must used just to ensure that always precisely two prisoners are pardoned.
