Inasmuch as the courts cannot alter the law, but only declare it and apply it to facts ascertained by them, it was early discovered that the only way in which they could adapt the law to hard cases, or stretch it to new cases, was by pretending a state of facts to fit the rule of law it was thought just to apply. Thus it was a rule of law that a deed takes effect from delivery, and the courts had no power to alter this rule; but if a grantor fraudulently or negligently delayed delivering his deed at the time it bore date, and afterward sought to claim some unjust advantage, as having continued to be owner meanwhile, the courts, not being able to change the rule of law, would by a fiction treat the delivery as relating back to the date. So, when legislation forbade transfers of land unless made publicly by record, the courts allowed an intending grantee to sue, alleging that the land belonged to him, and the intending grantor to suffer judgment to pass; thus by a fiction creating a mode of conveyance which, for all practical purposes, preserved the privacy of titles. Direct methods of improving the rules and forms of law have in recent times superseded the invention, and for the most part the use, of fictions.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">fiction</span> <span class="exp">Synonyms Fabrication, figment, fable, untruth, falsehood.</span> </li>
