						Many years ago, Haas et al.4 also reported surprisingly small diffusion coeﬃcients using similar polymer models (see also Ref. 5), but here the quenching mechanism of the terminal monomers of the peptides is through the longer range ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET).

						The ratio of the lengths to saddle (i.e., the L in (1.2)) of 2 ≈ 1.059463) according to the two consecutive frets is the twelfth root of two ( 12 equal temperament.

						The twelfth fret is placed at the exact half of the scale length, dividing the string in two exact halves. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Music in Terms of Science
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						Thus, when pressed at the twelfth fret a string will produce a note one octave higher from that of the open string (without being pressed anywhere between the nut and saddle so its vibrating length equals the scale length). 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Music in Terms of Science
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						A properly constructed guitar should guarantee that each of the six strings to vibrate as a stretched string with two ﬁxed ends, one at the saddle and the other at the fret where the string is pressed (usually by a left-hand ﬁnger), for every fret. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Music in Terms of Science
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						Frets placed at ﬁxed points allow the player to easily and consistently control the string’s vibrating length, without the need of ﬁne adjustment of the exact point (between two frets) on ﬁngerboard where the ﬁnger is pressing the string. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Music in Terms of Science
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						For bowed instruments such as violin, which do not have the damping problem due to continued string stimulation, unfretted ﬁngerboards are used to allow the player more control over ﬁne, subtle changes in pitch than fretted ﬁngerboards. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Music in Terms of Science

						A common way to tune a guitar is to compare the frequencies of various combinations of pairs of the guitar strings that are supposed to produce the same tone when pressed at appropriate frets.

					<div class="uAuthor">
						Music in Terms of Science
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						Thus, the B3 string pressed at the 5th fret should produce the E4 tone the same as that of the open high E string.

										<div class="usage">
						Because of its fretted ﬁngerboard, the same musical note can be played on different strings at different fret positions on a guitar, unlike the keyboard instrument where a note can only be played on one unique key. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Music in Terms of Science

						This offers a guitar player the choice of playing a note at different fret on a different string for achieving different tone color.

						At the same time, this give rise to challenges to beginners in ﬁnding the correct fret for a given note or getting familiarized with a variety of possible ﬁngerings for a given chord, which stays the same on a piano.

						However, because the frets are placed based on equal tempered tuning which is a technical compromise from the perfect tuning of the just intonation for a uniformly distributed semitone intervals (cf. section 2.1.2), most of the notes are supposed to be slightly out of tune.
