										<div class="usage">
						By now and with current experiments such as the INTEGRAL mission of ESA shown in Fig. 1.8, this technique has established an astronomical discipline of its own, the window of electromagnetic radiation clearly attributed to speciﬁc isotopes (Diehl et al, 2006).

						Introduction to Astronomy with Radioactivity
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						The ﬁrst astronomical discovery was made less than a century ago, and it has only been in the past two decades that major ventures in the discipline have taken place.

						Astronomy in Antarctica
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						Those nations that have managed to resile this conﬂict, between supplying the logistics and deciding upon the science, have managed to do the best Antarctic science, regardless of the scienti ﬁc discipline.

										<div class="usage">
						Elasticities are used in several scientiﬁc disciplines because they are directly interpretable and can be easily estimated from data .

										<div class="usage">
						As described above, we investigate stability in the context of a model that combines a scheduling discipline operating under interference constraints and a continuous spatial setting.

						Stability of Random Admissible-Set Scheduling in Spatial Wireless Systems
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						This is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that the result of Theorem 3.1 may not necessarily hold for seemingly similar but subtly different scheduling disciplines. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Stability of Random Admissible-Set Scheduling in Spatial Wireless Systems
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						Instead of selecting an admissible set at random, now consider the scheduling discipline that gives priority to particles that are closest, in anticlockwise direction, to a certain point ζ on the circle. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Stability of Random Admissible-Set Scheduling in Spatial Wireless Systems
					</div>

					<div class="uAuthor">
						Stability of Random Admissible-Set Scheduling in Spatial Wireless Systems
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						We demonstrated that the necessary condition is not suﬃcient to achieve stability for seemingly similar but subtly different scheduling disciplines such as maximal scheduling with priorities.
