								<li><span class="term">Trust</span> <span class="exp">A business organization or combination consisting of a number of firms or corporations operating, and often united, under an agreement creating a trust (in sense 1), esp. one formed mainly for the purpose of regulating the  supply and price of commodities, etc.; often, opprobriously, a combination formed for the purpose of controlling or monopolizing a trade, industry, or business, by doing acts in restraint or trade; as, a sugar <span class="wUex">trust</span>
            . A trust may take the form of a corporation or of a body of persons or corporations acting together by mutual arrangement, as under a contract or a so-called gentlemen's agreement. When it consists of corporations it may be effected by putting a majority of their stock either in the hands of a board of trustees (whence the name <span class="wUex">trust</span> for the combination) or by transferring a majority to a holding company. The advantages of a trust are partly due to the economies made possible in carrying on a large business, as well as the doing away with competition. In the United States severe statutes against trusts have been passed by the Federal government and in many States, with elaborate statutory definitions.</span> </li><li><span class="term">Trust</span> <span class="exp">An equitable right or interest in property distinct from the legal ownership thereof; a use (as it existed before the Statute of Uses); also, a property interest held by one person for the benefit of another.

In a looser sense the term is applied to any combination of establishments in the same line of business for securing the same ends by holding the individual interests of each subservient to a common authority for the common interests of all. It is against public policy for a stockholder to divest himself of his voting power; hence such a transfer of stock if made is revocable at the pleasure of the maker. So far as the object of such a combination is shown to be the control of prices of and the prevention of competition in the necessaries or conveniences of life, it is held a criminal act upon the principles which rendered engrossing and forestalling punishable; and a corporation which by corporate act surrenders its powers to the control of a trust thereby affords ground for a forfeiture of its charter by the state.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">trust</span> <span class="exp">The state of being confided in and relied on; the state of one to whom something is intrusted.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">trust</span> <span class="exp">The state of being confided to another's care or guard; charge.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">trust</span> <span class="exp">Keeping; care.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">trust</span> <span class="exp">Trustworthiness.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">trust</span> <span class="exp">A trust is also said to be executed when the trustee has performed his entire duty.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">trust</span> <span class="exp">When the instrument creating a trust in land has the effect by virtue of the statute of uses of vesting the entire estate in the intended beneficiary, the trust is said to be executed by the statute.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">trust</span> <span class="exp">A deed conveying property to a creditor in trust to sell and pay himself and restore the residue: a kind of mortgage.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">trust</span> <span class="exp">Synonyms and Faith, credence, assurance, dependence, expectation.</span> </li><li><span class="term">trust</span> <span class="exp">Held in trust: as, trust property; trust money.</span> </li><li><span class="term">trust</span> <span class="exp">To place or repose confidence in (a person); rely upon; depend upon.</span> </li><li><span class="term">trust</span> <span class="exp">To believe; credit; receive with credence, as a statement, assertion, or the like.</span> </li><li><span class="term">trust</span> <span class="exp">To intrust: with with before the object confided.</span> </li><li><span class="term">trust</span> <span class="exp">To commit, consign, or allow with confidence; permit to be in some place, position, or company, or to do some particular thing, without misgiving or fear of consequences: as, to trust one's self to another's guidance.</span> </li><li><span class="term">trust</span> <span class="exp">To give credit to; supply with goods or something of value in the expectation of future payment.</span> </li><li><span class="term">trust</span> <span class="exp">To entertain a lively hope; feel sure; expect confidently: followed by a clause.</span> </li><li><span class="term">trust</span> <span class="exp">To repose confidence; place faith or reliance; rely: with on or in.</span> </li><li><span class="term">trust</span> <span class="exp">To give credit for something due; sell on credit: as, to trust recklessly.</span> </li><li><span class="term">trust</span> <span class="exp">An obsolete spelling of trussed, preterit and past participle of truss.</span> </li>
