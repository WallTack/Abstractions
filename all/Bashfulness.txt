									<li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">bashfulness</span> <span class="exp">The quality of being bashful; excessive or extreme modesty; timorous shyness; want of confidence. [Formerly, like bashful, a term of commendation, equivalent to modesty.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">bashfulness</span> <span class="exp">Synonyms Bashfulness, Modesty, Diffidence, Shyness, Coyness, timidity, sheepishness. Bashfulness, literally readiness to be abashed, designates timidity and a disturbed state of feeling at meeting with others, or being brought into any prominence. It is natural and not unbecoming to the young, but with advancing years seems a defect; it is often a transient state of feeling. Modesty goes deeper into the character; it is either a proper and becoming distrust of one's self and one's powers, or a high-minded freedom from assurance and assumption; it is always an excellence, unless explicitly said to be excessive. Diffidence is a defect; it is an undue distrust of self, with fear of being censured for failure, tending to unfit one for duty. Shyness is simply a constitutional shrinking from contact with others; it is the result of sensitiveness. Coyness is shyness where advances are made by others; a shrinking from familiarity, perhaps in a coquettish way.</span> </li>
