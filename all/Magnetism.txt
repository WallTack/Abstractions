										Earth's magnetic field has been weakening. It seems to have lost 15% of its strength since 1670. At the present rate of decrease, it will reach zero in 2,000 years. Between the years 3500 and 4500, the magnetic field will not be sufficiently strong enough to ward off charged radiation from outer space.

									<li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">magnetism</span> <span class="exp">That peculiar property occasionally possessed by certain bodies (more especially by iron and steel) whereby, under certain circumstances, they naturally attract or repel one another according to determinate laws. According to the molecular theory of magnetism, the molecules of a magnetic substance possess permanent polarity, and as it is more and more highly magnetized the poles are arranged more and more perfectly in a common direction; when it is magnetized to the highest degree possible—that is, to saturation—all the north poles of the molecules point in one direction and all the south poles in the opposite direction. On this theory coercive force is simply that condition of the substance which retards this molecular arrangement during the process of magnetization and tends to retain it after magnetization. The current theory, or Ampère's theory of magnetism, supposes each molecule to be traversed by a closed electric circuit; these currents become parallel upon magnetization, and may then be regarded as equivalent to a series of closed electric currents about the exterior of the bar, these currents being clockwise at the south pole and counter-clock-wise at the north pole. This theory derives its support from the observed fact that a spiral conductor traversed by a current (a solenoid) behaves as a magnet in all respects, being directed similarly by the earth and having a similar field of force about it.
