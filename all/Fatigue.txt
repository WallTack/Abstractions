Fatigue is more often physical, but also mental, and is generally the result of active and strenuous exertion: as, the fatigue of ten hours' work, or of close application to books. Weariness may be the same as fatigue; it is, more often than fatigue, the result of less obvious causes, as long sitting or standing in one position, importunity from others, delays, and the like. Fatigue and weariness are natural conditions, from which one easily recovers by rest. Lassitude is a relaxation with languor, the result of greater fatigue or weariness than one can well bear, and may be of the nature of ill health. The word may, however, be used in a lighter sense.</span> </li>
