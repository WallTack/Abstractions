									<li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">subjectivism</span> <span class="exp">The doctrine that we can immediately know only what is present to consciousness. Those who adhere to this opinion either regard it as axiomatical, or fortify it by arguments analogous to those by which Zeno sought to prove that a particle can have only position, and not velocity, at any instant—arguments which appear, upon logical analysis, to beg the question. Those who oppose the opinion maintain that it would lead to the absurd corollary that there can be no cognition whatever, not even of a problematical or interrogatory kind, concerning anything but the immediate present.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">subjectivism</span> <span class="exp">The doctrine, sometimes termed relativism, that “man is the measure of things”—that is, that the truth is nothing but each man's settled opinion, there being no objective criterion of truth at all. This is an opinion held by some English philosophers, as well as by Protagoras in antiquity. It is a modification of subjectivism in sense 1, above.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">subjectivism</span> <span class="exp">Same as subjectivity, 3.</span> </li>
