The term is most frequently applied to the varieties of ritual and liturgical usage in England before the Reformation and to monastic and Roman usage as differing from these, and also to the different local varieties of the ancient Gallican offices. In England the several uses were those of Sarum, York, Hereford, Bangor, Lincoln, etc. These had a common family likeness, and differed considerably from Roman use. The most important of them was Sarum or Salisbury use, which was the form of service compiled about 1085 from various diocesan uses, English and Norman, by St. Osmund, bishop of Salisbury and chancellor of England. The use of Sarum prevailed throughout the greater part of England, and in 1542 it was ordered to be observed throughout the whole province of Canterbury. The Book of Common Prayer, first issued in 1549, and founded mainly on Salisbury use, established a uniform liturgy for the whole Church of England, but, except by implication of certain rubrics, left the exact mode of ritual observance in many respects unprovided for.

Since the Statute of Uses, the gift or grant of real property to the use of a person transfers to him directly the legal title; and the term trust is now commonly used to denote the kind of estate formerly signified by use, so far as the law now permits it to exist.
