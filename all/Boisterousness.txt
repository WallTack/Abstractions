							She mourn’d for her lover, Sir Frovin the brave,<br>
For he had embark’d on the boisterous wave;<br>
And, burning to gather the laurels of war,<br>
Had sail’d with King Humble to Orkney afar:

							The trailing clouds scowl o'er the shadowed main,<br>
And boisterous north winds, coming on apace,<br>
Sing loud discordant notes in weird refrain,<br>
Nor beast, nor bird comes from its hiding place.

							They lean close over her--and long, perhaps,<br>
For the broad seas and the loud wind that claps<br>
Boisterous hands on the Ship's course; and wait<br>
Her call who calls them with the voice of Fate.

While here not a leaf is in motion,<br>
And melody reigns in the dale.

Ere death divide us, and we part no more?

And causes many a fireside with boisterous talk to ring,<br>
And leaves behind it a deadly sting.
