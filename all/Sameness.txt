						As for iii), if all cyclic subgroups in A are conjugate, their ﬁxed point sets all have the same dimension and hence, by an inductive use of the Borel formula, the same holds for all subgroups (Zp )j of the same rank j in A, so we again reduce to case i).

						By the same reasoning as above, the other edge e(cid:48) with the same label must share the same vertices as e, and if e is not a loop, the cyclic nature of ˜T forces e and e(cid:48) to have the opposite directios.
