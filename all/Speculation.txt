										When Charles Darwin published his theory on human evolution in The Descent of Man in 1871, not a single fossil that was known to be pre-human had been found to back up his ideas. Although his theory was later proved to be true, it was formulated entirely without physical evidence and based almost completely on speculation.

This use of the word, though closely similar to the application of speculatio in the Latin of Boëthius to translate θεωρία, is chiefly due to 1 Cor. xiii. 12, “now we see through a glass, darkly,” where ‘glass’ is in the Vulgate speculum.

Thus, if a merchant lays in for his regular trade a much larger stock than he otherwise would because he anticipates a rise in prices, this is not termed speculation; but if he buys what he does not usually deal in, not for the purpose of extending his business, but for the chance of a sale of the particular articles at a profit by reason of anticipated rise, it is so termed.
