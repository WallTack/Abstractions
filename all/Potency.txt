Two scales of dilution or attenuation are employed, known as the centesimal and the decimal, the former being the one advocated by Hahnemann, and the latter of more recent introduction. In the decimal scale, one drop of the mother tincture is added to nine of the diluent, which is usually alcohol, with certain manipulations, and from this first decimal solution or potency one drop is taken, to form, with nine others of the diluent, the second decimal solution. This process is repeated till the required solution or potency is reached. Drugs of high potency are those of which the dilution has been frequently repeated, and the medicinal substance correspondingly attenuated; drugs of low potency, on the other hand, are those in a less diluted, more concentrated condition. The thirtieth (centesimal) potency was the highest recommended by Hahnemann.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">potency</span> <span class="exp">Power dependent on external circumstances; material strength or force; authority.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">potency</span> <span class="exp">Influence; power; sovereignty.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">potency</span> <span class="exp">Same as potence, 2.</span> </li>
