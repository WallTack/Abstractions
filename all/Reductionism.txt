						The main purpose of what has been said until now is just to ”problematize” ob jectiveness, namely, to question it and to consider whether it is either a cause or a symptom of larger problems, especially within last century’s perspective, i. e. reductionism.

						We are not surprised that a famous biologist, Ernst Mayr, was the ﬁrst who clearly deﬁned all the different kinds of reductionisms , with the purpose of circumscribing their applicability.

						Constitutive reductionism, namely the scientiﬁc method in which one studies the components to understand the system is no doubt the key to success of decades of science, and no scientist doubts this.

						However, in its strong forms, reductionism states that to understand complex phenomena one needs only to understand the microscopic laws governing all the elements of the system that make up the phenomena.

						The counterpoint to reductionism is System Theory, that states that a system very often organizes itself into patterns that cannot be understood in terms of the laws governing the single elements.

						It seems clear that reductionism is not enough to describe systems where the pattern of information ﬂow often plays a role more important than that of microscopic dynamics, for example, in phase transitions.

						An even deeper assumption underneath this one, is reductionism : short-range physics completely determines long-range physics, and the former is more fundamental than the latter.
