Hint, Intimate, Suggest, Insinuate. To hint is to convey an idea in the lightest possible manner, and especially by implication; to let one's thought be known in an indirect, hesitating, or partial manner. To intimate is to convey one's meaning more plainly than by a hint, but still not directly or explicitly. Suggest has a somewhat wide range, often meaning essentially the same as propose or remind (one) of, and ranging down to the meaning of hint: as, to suggest a plan; to suggest more than one says. Insinuate is now generally used in a bad sense; when used in a good sense, it implies pains taken and delicacy of skill. Hints and insinuations are always covert, intimations often, suggestions rarely. An innuendo is a peculiarly dark, crafty, or mean insinuation.</span> </li><li><span class="term">hint</span> <span class="exp">To make an indirect reference, suggestion, or allusion.</span> </li><li><span class="term">hint</span> <span class="exp">Synonyms Allude (to), Refer (to), etc. See advert, v. i.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">hint</span> <span class="exp">An act of exertion; a snatch: as, in a hint, in a moment.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">hint</span> <span class="exp">An opportunity; a fit time.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">hint</span> <span class="exp">A suggestion made indirectly; a covert suggestion or implication; an indirect indication, conveyed by speech, gesture, action, or circumstance, whether intentional or unintentional.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">hint</span> <span class="exp">Synonyms See hint, v. t.</span> </li><li><span class="term">hint</span> <span class="exp">Behind.</span> </li>
