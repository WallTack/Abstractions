							If so, why am I not contented<br>
To endure this hateful chain?<br>
Why have I constantly invented<br>
Schemes my liberty to gain;<br>
And with firm, heroic brav'ry,<br>
Ventur'd my life to flee from slav'ry?

							They platted next a new invented crown<br>
Of thorns, and o'er his temples press'd it down,<br>
Until the blood well'd from each spouting wound,<br>
And streaming down his cheeks, inrich'd the ground.

											<div class="poemQuote">
							Oh, are we not as little boys<br>
Striving to conquer sea and air,<br>
Playing a while with futile toys<br>
To fight the bogey of despair?<br>
While, in the end, invention's lure<br>
Finds us relief - but never cure.

											<div class="poemQuote">
							Invention? Men may, late or soon,<br>
Thro' high ambition's urge, aspire,<br>
And, so aspiring, win the boon<br>
Of great and ultimate desire.<br>
But art? Or talkies? Nothing loth,<br>
I'm game to own there's room for both.

											<div class="poemQuote">
							What was chiefly in use before guns were invented,<br>
