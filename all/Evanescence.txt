						In the framework of dimensional regularization, the transformation corresponding to the change of basis turns out to be more complicated, as it generally involves evanescent operators as well. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Effective Hamiltonian for Non-Leptonic |Delta F| = 1 Decays at NNLO in QCD
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						This feature basically reﬂects the fact that in order to formulate consistently the dimensional regularization of a theory containing fermionic degrees of freedom, the Dirac algebra has to be inﬁnite-dimensional, which implies that evanescent operators are necessary to form a complete basis in n = 4 − 2ǫ dimensions. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Effective Hamiltonian for Non-Leptonic |Delta F| = 1 Decays at NNLO in QCD
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						In consequence, specifying the evanescent operators is necessary to make precise the deﬁnition of the MS scheme in the effective theory beyond LO, as can been seen for instance in Eq. (35). 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Effective Hamiltonian for Non-Leptonic |Delta F| = 1 Decays at NNLO in QCD
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						As long as the change of basis does not mix physical and evanescent operators, the ADM still changes in a trivial way. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Effective Hamiltonian for Non-Leptonic |Delta F| = 1 Decays at NNLO in QCD
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						In particular, a linear transformation of evanescent operators does not affect the physical ADM at all. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Effective Hamiltonian for Non-Leptonic |Delta F| = 1 Decays at NNLO in QCD
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						Indeed, as we will explain in a moment, the new ADM is still given by Eq. (79), but the presence of evanescent operators induces a ﬁnite renormalization constant for the physical operators in the new basis. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Effective Hamiltonian for Non-Leptonic |Delta F| = 1 Decays at NNLO in QCD
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						In this case the new ADM is still given by Eq. (79) because of the absence of mixing of evanescent into physical operators in the original basis.

					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Effective Hamiltonian for Non-Leptonic |Delta F| = 1 Decays at NNLO in QCD
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						However, some linear combinations of them will become parts of either the physical or the evanescent operators in the “traditional” basis through the change of basis given by Eq. (84).

						At this point a comment concerning the computation of the renormalization constants involving the insertions of the additional evanescent operators is in order.

					<div class="uAuthor">
						Effective Hamiltonian for Non-Leptonic |Delta F| = 1 Decays at NNLO in QCD

						The idea of introducing more and more evanescent operators seems to make the use of an naive anticommuting γ5 in multi-loop calculations involving chiral operators futile. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Effective Hamiltonian for Non-Leptonic |Delta F| = 1 Decays at NNLO in QCD
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						The complete list of trace evanescent operators relevant to ﬁnd the transformation of the three-loop anomalous dimensions between the initial and the “traditional” basis is given in Appendix A.2. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Effective Hamiltonian for Non-Leptonic |Delta F| = 1 Decays at NNLO in QCD

					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">

					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						As regards the relevance of the trace evanescent operators deﬁned in Eqs. (A.4) and (A.5), let us ﬁnally point out, that it would be incorrect to conclude that they are only needed to ﬁnd the transformation of the three-loop anomalous dimensions matrices between the initial and the “traditional” basis of operators.

						In fact, their role in the “traditional” basis is the same as the one of the evanescent operators introduced in Eq. (90), as they, together with the latter ones, make precise the deﬁnition of the renormalization scheme in that basis at the NNLO.
