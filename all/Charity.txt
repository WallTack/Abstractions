Early in the history of English law, the chancellors established the rule that informalities and illegalities which by the common law would invalidate a private trust should not be allowed to defeat a public charity, and that therefore chancery should intervene to prevent the heirs or next of kin from defeating such a gift, should appoint a trustee if none existed, and, if any of the directions of the founder were impracticable, should supply others approximate thereto. The most familiar application of the rule is in the doctrine that the prohibition against perpetuities does not affect a charity. (See perpetuity.)
