						More generally, the t-step counter-assisted mode is deﬁned by incrementing and adding the counter once every t iterations, and using each t-tuple as the input of a new output function ˆg : X t → Y t .

						Using the results from , we get that for all t, the output function of the t-step counter-assisted mode can be modiﬁed in a black-box manner with a small computational overhead, to get the same diversity and pseudorandomness results.

						We can achieve this goal via letting the next state be the same as when clocking the (standard) counter-assisted generator t times (that is, the counter is incremented and added to the xi value every clock).

						To these we can add practical problems such as the challenge of ﬁnding a seed s for which the counter-assisted generator with DES as the iteration function has DDE S (s)(k) ≈ √k for some large k , and theoretical problems such as statistical analysis of the behavior of the state sequence of counterassisted generators.
