										In 1850, Michigan's state constitution included the following line: "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, unless for the punishment of crime, shall ever be tolerated in this state." This inadvertently legalized slavery as an appropriate punishment for crime. It wasn't until 1963 that the grammar was fixed to outlaw slavery. The change required shifting the comma following "servitude" to the position after "slavery."

										<div class="usage">
						For a ﬁxed tolerance α, we ﬁnd a vanishing breakdown probability Pb for small ∆0 , which corresponds to “well-connected” systems where the failing load is redistributed to a large number of other elements.

						If we use a more realistic distribution of redistribution factors ∆, our results on the critical behavior of the breakdown probability with respect to failure tolerance and connectivity, e.g., may give valuable information for the design of more robust infrastructure systems.

						In practice, we break this symmetry by demanding that xC ≤ xD and that xC + xD ≤ 1; we consider only the permutation (or relabelling) of stars that satisﬁes these conditions (within noise tolerance).
