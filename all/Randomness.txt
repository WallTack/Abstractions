						Almost sure convergence for stochastically biased random walks on trees

										<div class="usage">
						In order to exhibit the slow movement, the transition probabilities need to be random (which was already the case in the aforementioned work of Ben Arous and Hammond ): the resulting random walk (Xn ) is a so-called random walk in random environment.

						It turns out that in Wang’s construction, the martingale M is already {0, 1}valued, hence it immediately follows that Schnorr randomness (a fortiori Kurtz randomness) does not imply ﬁnitely-valued randomness (and a fortiori integervalued randomness).
