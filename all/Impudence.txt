Impertinence is primarily non-pertinence, conduct not pertaining or appropriate to the circumstances, and is hence a disposition to meddle with what does not pertain to one, and more specifically unmannerly conduct or speech. Impudence is unblushing impertinence manifesting itself in words, tones, gestures, looks, etc. Effrontery is extreme impudence, which is not abashed at rebuke, but shows unconcern for the opinion of others; it is audacious and brazen-faced. Sauciness is a sharp kind of impertinence, chiefly in language, and primarily from an inferior. It is, in language, essentially the same with pertness, which, however, covers all indecorous freedom of bearing toward others; pertness is forwardness inappropriate to one's years, station, or sex. Rudeness is the only one of these words seeming to refer primarily to character; in this use it implies manners or language which might be expected from lack of culture or good breeding, and includes what is said or done from a desire to be offensive or uncivil. See arrogance.</span> </li>
