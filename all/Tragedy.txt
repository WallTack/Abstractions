Types of these characters are found in Shakspere's Lady Macbeth and Ophelia, Rowe's Jane Shore, and Scott's Master of Ravenswood. Tragedy originated among the Greeks in the worship of the god Dionysus or Bacchus. A Greek tragedy consisted of two parts—the dialogue, which corresponded in its general features to the dramatic compositions of modern times; and the chorus, the tone of which was lyrical rather than dramatical, and which was meant to be sung, while the dialogue was to be recited.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">tragedy</span> <span class="exp">[capitalized] Tragedy personified, or the Muse of tragedy.
