It was made the occasion of offerings for the poor, and closed with devotional exercises, including the kiss of love. According to late usage, agapæ were also associated with weddings, funerals, anniversaries of martyrdoms, and the dedication of churches. The loss of their original character and the growth of abuses led to the prohibition of them in church buildings, and in the fourth century to their separation from the Lord's supper and their gradual discontinuance. Vestiges of the practice, however, remained as late as the Council of Basle in the fifteenth century, and customs historically derived from it are still observed by some denominations.
