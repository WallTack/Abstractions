The common thrift is A. vulgaris (A. maritima), a plant abounding on the shores, also in the mountains, of the northern Old World, found also on the western coast of North America, and appearing again in the southern hemisphere beyond the tropics. It grows in tufts of several leafless stalks from a rosette of many narrow radical leaves. The flowers are pink or sometimes white, disposed in dense heads. The plant is often cultivated for borders. Old or local names are lady's-cushion, sea-pink, sea-thrift, and sea-gillyflower. The plantain-leaved thrift is A. plantaginea, like the former, but with much broader leaves. The great thrift, A. latifolia (A. cephalotes), of the Mediterranean region, is highly recommended for gardens, but is somewhat tender.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">thrift</span> <span class="exp">Same as thrift-box.</span> </li>
