In modern usage an appeal implies not merely a preliminary objection, but a proceeding for review after a decision has been rendered. As now used, it is a proceeding derived from the courts of equity. The mode of review at common law was formerly not to remove the cause, but only to bring up specific points or questions by writs of error. This was changed in England by the judicature acts of 1873–5, and there is now one Court of Appeal for all cases. In Scotland the highest appellate court is the Court of Session. The judgments of both these courts may be appealed to the House of Lords. In the United States the appeal has been to a great extent substituted for the writ of error. The highest appellate courts are, for federal questions arising in either federal or State courts, the United States Supreme Court; for other questions, the supreme courts, courts of appeal, or courts of error of the various States, the practice being wholly regulated by statutes.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">appeal</span> <span class="exp">The mode of procedure by which such removal is effected.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">appeal</span> <span class="exp">The right of removal to a higher court.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">appeal</span> <span class="exp">Formerly, a vindictive action at the suit of a party injured when the supposed criminal had been previously acquitted on an indictment or pardoned.
