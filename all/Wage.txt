										<span class="fHeader">Interesting fact:</span>
										The kilt was invented by a English gentleman who came to Scotland to open a factory because he got tired of his Scottish workers showing up in a long tunic with a belt (they couldn't afford pants). Rather than raise wages so they could afford pants he invented the kilt which is just a lot of fabric and they could afford that. The kilt did not become a symbol of clan pride until the English banned the kilt in Scotland. Then it became part of national pride to wear the newly invented clan plaids.
