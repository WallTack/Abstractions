						These include those noted by Creutz, which follow from performing U (1)e transformations [corresponding to spin-taste (g5 ⊗ x5 )], but also many others because of the extended SU (4) taste symmetry.

					<div class="uAuthor">
						Rooted staggered fermions: good, bad or ugly?

						Despite this extended structure, if one uses taste-singlet sources the fermionic weight reduces to that of QCD with physical sources: det1/4 h( eDcont ⊗ 1) + J i −→ det[ eDcont + eJ ] . J −→ ( eJ ⊗ 1) Thus the physical subsector of the extended PQ theory is not constrained by the additional Ward identities.
