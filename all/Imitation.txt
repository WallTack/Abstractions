The original phrase or theme is often called the antecedent, and the imitation the consequent. Imitation is reckoned one of the chief beauties of polyphonic writing and of composition in general. Its esthetic value lies in the combined unity and variety that it introduces into intricate works, and in the opportunity it affords for ingenuity and skill. Imitation is said to be strict when the succession of intervals is identical in both antecedent and consequent, and free when some modification of the one appears in the other. The commonest regular varieties of free imitation are: by augmentation (augmented imitation), in which the rhythmic value of the several tones is systematically increased, as when quarter-notes are represented by half-notes; by diminution (diminished imitation), in which the rhythmic value of the several tones is systematically lessened, as when quarter-notes are represented by eighth-notes; by inversion (inverted imitation, inverted counterpoint, or imitation in contrary motion), in which every upward interval in the antecedent is represented in the consequent by an equivalent downward interval, and vice versa; and retrograde or reversed imitation, in which the intervals of the antecedent are taken in reverse order in the consequent. The interval of pitch by which the consequent is separated from the antecedent is indicated by calling the imitation at the fifth, at the octave, etc. Strict imitation is canonic, and the result, if of some extent, is a canon (which see); imitation is also the basis of the fugue (which see).</span> </li><li><span class="term">imitation</span> <span class="exp">Made in imitation; counterfeit; not genuine; copied: as, imitation stone, lace, gold, etc.</span> </li>
