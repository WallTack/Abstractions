The right of challenge is given in both civil and criminal trials, for certain reasons which are supposed to disqualify a juror to be an impartial judge. The challenge may extend either to the whole panel or body of jurors, called a challenge to the array, or only to particular jurors, called a challenge to the polls. Both of these challenges are subdivided into principal challenges (or challenges for principal cause) and challenges to the favor. A principal challenge is a challenge which alleges a fact of such a nature that, if proved, the juror is disqualified as a matter of law, without inquiring whether he is actually impartial: as, that one or more of the jury are returned at the nomination of the other party, or are nearly related to the other party. A challenge to the favor consists in the allegation by the party of a cause that might probably bias, and the raising of the question whether the juror is in fact impartial: as, a statement that a juror has already formed an opinion, or is prejudiced against the party. A peremptory challenge, allowed by statute in many jurisdictions, is a challenge of jurors, to a limited number, to be taken without showing any cause at all.</span> </li><li><span class="term">challenge</span> <span class="exp">To accuse; call to answer; censure.</span> </li><li><span class="term">challenge</span> <span class="exp">To lay claim to; demand as due or as a right: as, the Supreme Being challenges our reverence and homage.</span> </li><li><span class="term">challenge</span> <span class="exp">To call, invite, or summon to single combat or duel.</span> </li><li><span class="term">challenge</span> <span class="exp">To call to a contest; call into opposing activity; invite to a trial; defy: as, to challenge a man to prove what he asserts (implying defiance).</span> </li><li><span class="term">challenge</span> <span class="exp">To take exception to; object to (a person or thing); call in question: as, to challenge the accuracy of a statement.
