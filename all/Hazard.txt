									<li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">hazard</span> <span class="exp">The leading game at dice. The instruments are a box and two dice. The players are a caster and any number of setters. The setter stakes his money upon the table; the caster accepts the bet if he chooses, and must cover the setter's money if required. The setter can bar any throw. The caster first calls a main — that is, he calls any of the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. He then throws his chance. If this is 2, 3, 11, or 12, it is called crabs and he loses, unless the main were 7 and he throws 11, or the main were 6 or 8 and he throws 12. In these cases, and also if he throws the main, his throw is called nick, and he wins. If he throws neither crabs nor nick, he must continue to throw until he again throws the main or his chance; if he throws the former first, the setter wins, if the latter the caster wins.
