All the Assyrian weights had two values, the heavy being double the light, and there were also various types of each. The royal Babylonian commercial talent (or Assyrian talent) was divided into 60 minas, and each mina into 60 shekels. Its value (light weight) was in one type 29.63 kilograms (65 pounds 5 ounces avoirdupois), and in another 30.10 kilograms (66 pounds 5½ ounces). Derivatives of this talent (which was equivalent to 3,000 shekels) were in use in Syria and Palestine and in Phenician colonies. Its money value is reckoned as approximately from $1,700 to $2,000. The Babylonian gold talent contained only 50 minas, and was thus five sixths of the commercial weight. The Babylonian silver talent was formed by multiplying the commercial talent by 13⅓ (the ratio of silver to an equivalent mass of gold), and afterward dividing by 10. The resulting light talent was sometimes again divided by 2. Derivatives of this talent were in use in Persia, Lydia, Macedonia, and Italy. It is the basis of much of the most ancient silver coinage. The Phenician silver talent, probably derived from the Babylonian, was in its lighter types about 43.4 kilograms (95 pounds 9 ounces avoirdupois), and, being halved, was adopted into the Ptolemaic system. The chief Greek talents were as follows: Old Æginetan, 40.3 kilograms (88 pounds 12 ounces); emporetic Attic (substantially later Æginetan), 36.4 kilograms (80 pounds 4 ounces); Solonic (= Egyptian), 25.8 kilograms (56 pounds 14 ounces). Talents mentioned by Homer and some other of the oldest writers appear to be small weights, perhaps shekels. The later Attic talent contained 60 minas, or 6,000 Attic drachmas, equal to 56 pounds 14 ounces. As a denomination of silver money it was equal to about $1,000. The great talent of the Romans is computed to be equal to £99 6s. 8d. sterling, or about $480, and the little talent to £75 sterling, or about $363.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">talent</span> <span class="exp">Money; wealth; property in general.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">talent</span> <span class="exp">Hence, a wealth; an abundance (as in the phrase ‘a wealth of golden hair’); or, perhaps, gold (i. e. ‘golden tresses’).</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">talent</span> <span class="exp">A gift committed to one for use and improvement: so called in allusion to the parable of the talents (Mat. xxv.); hence, a peculiar faculty, endowment, or aptitude; a capacity for achievement or success.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">talent</span> <span class="exp">Mental power of a superior order; superior intelligence; special aptitude; abilities; parts: often noting power or skill acquired by cultivation, and thus contrasted with genius.
