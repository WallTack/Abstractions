Education in a broad sense, with reference to man, comprehends all that disciplines and enlightens the understanding, corrects the temper, cultivates the taste, and forms the manners and habits; in a narrower sense, it is the special course of training pursued, as by parents or teachers, to secure any one or all of these ends. Under physical education is included all that relates to the development and care of the organs of sensation and of the muscular and nervous system. Intellectual education comprehends the means by which the powers of the understanding are developed and improved, and knowledge is imparted. Esthetic education is the development of the sense of the beautiful, and of technical skill in the arts. Moral education is the cultivation of the moral nature. Technical education is intended to train persons in the arts and sciences that underlie the practice of the trades or professions. Education is further divided into primary education, or instruction in the first elements of knowledge, received by children in common or elementary schools or at home; secondary, that received in grammar and high schools or in academies; higher, that received in colleges, universities, and postgraduate study; and special or professional, that which aims to fit one for the particular vocation or profession in which he is to engage. With reference to animals, the word is used in the narrowest sense of training in useful or amusing acts or habits.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">education</span> <span class="exp">The rearing of animals, especially bees, silkworms, or the like; culture, as of bacteria in experimenting; a brood or collection of cultivated creatures.</span> </li>
