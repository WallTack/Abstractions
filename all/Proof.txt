Proof is either written or parole. The former consists of records, deeds, or other writings; the latter of the testimony of witnesses personally appearing in court or before a proper officer, and, as a rule, sworn to the truth of what they depose. In this sense the word is used to designate either the task of going forward with the giving of evidence at the trial or the task of satisfying the minds of the jury. Owing to the different functions of the judge and the jury, the distinction is of great practical importance, because when the plaintiff has given evidence which would entitle him if unanswered to go to the jury, it is proper for him to tell counsel that the burden of proof is on defendant, meaning that if the defendant adduces no evidence the plaintiff will be entitled to have the case submitted to the jury; but it is error for him thereupon, whether defendant offers evidence or not, to tell the jury that the burden of proof is on defendant to contradict plaintiff's case, for, considered as a task of satisfying the jury, the burden of proof remains upon the plaintiff throughout. The burden of proof is never on the defendant in this sense, except in respect to an affirmative defense in avoidance as distinguished from a denial.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">proof</span> <span class="exp">In Scots law, the taking of evidence by a judge upon an issue framed in pleading.
