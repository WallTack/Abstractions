Beat is a general, somewhat indefinite, but vigorous word, covering the others. Overpower and overwhelm are the least discreditable to the one that loses in the struggle; overpower is least permanent in its effects. To overpower is to overcome by superiority of strength or numbers, but the disadvantage may be changed by the arrival of reinforcements. To overwhelm is to bear down utterly, to sweep clear away by superior strength. Defeat is to overcome or get the better of in some kind of contest, and implies less discredit, but generally greater disaster, to the defeated party than beat: as, that army is considered beaten which withdraws from the field. Defeat implies a serious disadvantage, because it applies more often to large numbers engaged. Discomfit has fallen into comparative disuse, except in its secondary sense of foiling, etc.; in that it expresses a comparatively complete and mortifying defeat. Rout is to defeat and drive off the field in confusion. Overthrow is the most decisive and final of these words; it naturally applies only to great persons, concerns, armies, etc. See conquer.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">defeat</span> <span class="exp">An undoing; ruin; destruction.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">defeat</span> <span class="exp">In law, the act of annulling, or of rendering null and void; annulment: as, the defeat of a title.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">defeat</span> <span class="exp">The act of depriving a person of something expected, desired, or striven for, by some antagonistic action or influence.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">defeat</span> <span class="exp">The act or result of overcoming in a contest, viewed with reference to the person overcome; overthrow; vanquishment; rout: as, to inflict a severe defeat upon the enemy.</span> </li>

										Mayonnaise is said to be the invention of the French chef of the Duke de Richelieu in 1756. While the Duke was defeating the British at Port Mahon, his chef was creating a victory feast that included a sauce made of cream and eggs. When the chef realized that there was no cream in the kitchen, he improvised, substituting olive oil for the cream. A new culinary masterpiece was born, and the chef named it "Mahonnaise" in honor of the Duke's victory.
