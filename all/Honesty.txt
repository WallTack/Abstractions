The perennial honesty is L. rediviva; the maiden's-honesty is Clematis Vitalba. Synonyms Honesty, Honor, Integrity, Probity, Rectitude, Uprightness; equity, trustworthiness, trustiness, fidelity, fairness, candor, veracity, plain-dealing; frankness. The first six words apply primarily to the spirit of the person, and by extension to conduct, etc. They may be negative or positive, expressing the spirit or the act of refraining or of doing. Honesty belongs to the absolute principle of right; honor, on the other hand, belongs to accepted standards of what is due to others or to one's self. Conformity to an exalted standard of honor is more creditable and illustrious than simple honesty. In earlier usage honest and honesty retained much of their Latin significance of honorable and honorableness in the objective sense. (See Rom. xii. 17.) Integrity means soundness, and is used with especial reference to trusts (as, a man of strict business integrity), but it may consider a person as inspected and found whole by others or by himself. Probity is tested honesty, tried and proved integrity. Rectitude and uprightness draw their meanings from the idea of standing up straight, and hence matching the standard of right, but uprightness is more manifestly connected with this idea, and hence, as well as on account of its native origin, is much the more vigorous of the two.
