Thus, the use of steam-power, though on one's own premises and for a lawful purpose, may be a nuisance, if by reason of being in one of several closely built dwellings the vibration and noise cause unreasonable injury to the adjacent property and occupants. Any serious obstruction to a highway or navigable river if not authorized by law is a nuisance; but the temporary use of a reasonable part of a highway for a legitimate purpose, such as the moving of a building or the deposit of building materials going into use, is not necessarily a nuisance. The question of nuisance always is, at what point the selfish use of a right transcends the obligation to respect the welfare of others. A common nuisance, or public nuisance, is one which tends to the annoyance of the public generally, and is therefore to be redressed by forcible abatement or by an action by the state, as distinguished from a private nuisance, or one which causes special injury to one or more individuals and therefore will sustain a private action. Thus, if one obstructs a highway any person may remove the obstruction, but only the public can prosecute the offender, unless a particular individual suffers special injury, as where he is turned from his road and compelled to go another way and suffers thereby a specific pecuniary damage, in which case it is as to him a private nuisance, and he may sue.</span> </li>
