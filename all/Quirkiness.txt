						The subjects of subject raising verbs, such as vir(cid:19)ist ‘seems’, 4.2 Icelandic Quirky Case Marking Quirky Case marking in Icelandic presents a more complex array of linguistic data which exercises a wider range of f-term machinery. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Features as Resources in R-LFG
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						The f-term simpliﬁes straightforwardly to type t. quirky case assigning verb then the matrix subject is assigned the quirky case, rather than nominative (17d). 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">

										<div class="usage">
						Thus if a subject NP receives a quirky case, then that must be the case that it appears in.

										<div class="usage">
						On the other hand, if the subject NP is not assigned a quirky case, then the only case available is structural nominative case.

						The lexical entry for the quirky case marking verb vantar ‘lacks’ in (24) differs from that for the non-quirky verb kyssti ‘kissed’ in that it assigns an accusative case to its subject (in the underlined part of the f-term) as well as to its object.

										<div class="usage">
						The syntactic rules and lexical entries introduced above that are independently needed to account for quirky case marking in single clause constructions and for Subject Raising without quirky case also correctly account for the interaction of those two constructions, which was presented in (17d) on page 14.

						Just as in the single clause quirky case marking example (17b), the subject NP is assigned both an accusative case and an optional nominative case, so only an accusative subject NP can appear.
