						If i is odd, then at the beginning of slot si , B is executing Ii−1 (the interval accepted by B in slot si−1 ) and A is idle. B will run Ii−1 to completion while A will accept the heaviest interval among those arriving during this slot.

						For i &gt; 1, consider the ﬁrst interval I ′ accepted by OP T in slot si = [d(Ii−2 ), d(Ii−1 )). (Recall that accepting a job means starting the job and then executing it to completion without interruption.) Since the start of slot si is after r(Ii−1 ), we have r(I ′ ) &gt; r(Ii−1 ).

						The job accepted by an algorithm A in slot s is denoted by A(s). (Any algorithm can accept at most one job in each slot since the slot has the same length as a job.) We deﬁne the inverse A−1 (x) to be the slot s with A(s) = x, if it exists; otherwise it is undeﬁned.

						Our approach to the proof is to map (or charge) the weights of jobs accepted by OP T to slots where A or B have accepted ‘suﬃciently heavy’ jobs; namely, that each slot s receives a charge at most 1.5 times of w(A(s)) or w(B (s)).

						For B , either it has accepted the job OP T (s) before s, in which case we charge the remaining half to that slot (this is also a self charge); or OP T (s) is still pending at slot s − 1, which means at slot s − 1, B accepts a job with weight at least w(OP T (s)).

						Improved Randomized Online Scheduling of Intervals and Jobs
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						The method is often implemented by drawing a Uniform[0, 1] variate, ua , and accepting if it is less than the acceptance probability. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Driving Markov chain Monte Carlo with a dependent random stream
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						The two chains (naive and penalty method) separate when Vt falls between the two acceptance probabilities, since then the chains make different accept/reject decisions. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Coupled MCMC with a randomized acceptance probability
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						The ﬁrst move “ label-swap ” randomly chooses two cluster labels according to their prior probabilities p i = γi/γ , then proposes to swap them and accepts this move by using the usual Metropolis-Hastings accept/reject rule. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Gibbs Sampling for (Coupled) Infinite Mixture Models in the Stick Breaking Representation
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						Since its foundation it implemented the publication model common in computer science: there was one conference deadline; conference submissions were reviewed by a program committee; papers were accepted with a low acceptance rate. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						A Revised Publication Model for ECML PKDD
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						Submissions that are accepted, are then automatically accepted for the conference as well. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						A Revised Publication Model for ECML PKDD
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						Low acceptance percentages, combined with variable review quality, causes acceptance to be highly random.
