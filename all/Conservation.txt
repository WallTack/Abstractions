										Daylight savings time started during World War I, so Americans could use as much natural lighting as possible and conserve energy needed for war production. Despite the Uniform Time Act, which Congress passed in 1966 to standardize the time change, several states within the United States do not observe Daylight Saving Time. They are Arizona, Hawaii, parts of Indiana, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa.
