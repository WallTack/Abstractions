						The latter was shown to be tied to the reduced dimensionality of excitons, being well apparent in GaAs wells of thickness of the order of 5 nm, but disappearing rapidly for larger well sizes.

						The condition for well deﬁned quasiparticles to exists, βω2 (cid:28) ω , means that as one increases the parameter β , which characterizes the strength of electron-electron excitations, the maximum energy of well-deﬁned excitations decreases, but well-deﬁned quasiparticles will still exist at low energies.

						If x ∈ G is well-behaving, then ˜f (x) = f (x); if x ∈ G We now deﬁne a one-one map is not well-behaving then ˜f (x) is an element in Γ2 chosen arbitrarily in a way such as ˜f (x) 6= ˜f (y) for distinct not well-behaving elements x, y of G.

						This suggests that light scattering gives access to new information on the damping mechanisms in multiquantum wells, possibly excluding the inhomogeneous broadening from well to well owing to the delocalized nature of the probing acoustic phonons.

						The cutoff, Λ, which deﬁnes the boundary between these two kinds of modes is chosen to lie well below the high-energy scale (i.e. well below mR in the toy model) but is also chosen to lie well above the low-energy scale of ultimate interest (like the centre-of-mass energies, E , of low-energy scattering amplitudes).
