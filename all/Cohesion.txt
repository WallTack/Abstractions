									<li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">cohesion</span> <span class="exp">The act or state of cohering, uniting, or sticking together; specifically, in physical, the state in which, or the force by which, the molecules of the same material are bound together, so as to form a continuous homogeneous mass. This force acts sensibly at insensible distances—that is, when the particles of matter which it unites are placed in apparent contact. At insensible distances it is a much greater, at sensible distances a much smaller, force than gravitation, so that it does not follow the law of variation of the latter. It unites the particles of a homogeneous body, and is thus distinguished from adhesion, which takes place between the molecules of different masses or substances, as between fluids and solids, and from chemical attraction, which unites the atoms of a molecule together. The power of cohesion in a body is estimated by the force necessary to pull its parts asunder. In general, cohesion is most powerful among the particles of solid bodies, weaker among those of fluids, and least of all, or entirely wanting, in elastic fluids, as air and gases. Hardness, softness, tenacity, elasticity, malleability, ductility, and in crystallized bodies cleavage, are to be considered properties dependent upon cohesion. The most powerful influence which tends to diminish cohesion is heat, as shown in the change of a solid to a liquid, or of a liquid to a gas, which is effected by it.
