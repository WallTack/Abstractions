						We then proved that if the temperature T is a computable real number with 0 &lt; T &lt; 1 then, for each of these thermodynamic quantities, the partial randomness of its value equals to T , where the notion of partial randomness is a stronger representation of the compression rate by means of program-size complexity.

						Theorem 3.4 is just a ﬁxed point theorem on partial randomness, where the computability of the value Z (T ) gives a suﬃcient condition for a real number T ∈ (0, 1) to be a ﬁxed point on partial randomness.
