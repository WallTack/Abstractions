Slavery seems to have existed everywhere from very early times. It is recognized in the Old Testament as a prevailing custom, and the Levitical laws contain many regulations in regard to slaves and their rights and duties. Serfdom died out gradually in England in the latter part of the middle ages, and slavery was abolished throughout the British empire in 1833, after long agitation, the sum of twenty million pounds sterling being paid as compensation to the slave-owners. Negro slavery was introduced into the present territory of the United States in 1620, and became recognized as an institution. The Northern States gradually got rid of their slaves by emancipation or transportation in the latter part of the eighteenth and the early part of the nineteenth century. Slavery became a leading and agitating question from the time of the Missouri Compromise (1820), and the number of slave States increased to fifteen.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">slavery</span> <span class="exp">Servitude; the continuous and exhausting labor of a slave; drudgery.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">slavery</span> <span class="exp">The act of enslaving.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">slavery</span> <span class="exp">Synonyms Bondage, etc. See servitude.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">slavery</span> <span class="exp">Vassalage, thraldom, serfdom, peonage.</span> </li>

										In 1850, Michigan's state constitution included the following line: "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, unless for the punishment of crime, shall ever be tolerated in this state." This inadvertently legalized slavery as an appropriate punishment for crime. It wasn't until 1963 that the grammar was fixed to outlaw slavery. The change required shifting the comma following "servitude" to the position after "slavery."
