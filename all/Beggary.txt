				<div class="etymology">
					OE. <span class="wUets">beggerie</span>,. See <span class="wUer">Beggar</span> (n.) 
				</div>	
								<div class="dName">Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary</div>
				<div class="etymology">
					The ety. is very obscure; the words <i>beg</i> and <i>beggar</i> first appear in the 13th century, and Dr Murray thinks the most likely derivation is from the O. Fr. <i>begart</i>, <i>begard</i>, and <i>begar</i> (L. <i>beghardus</i> = <i>beghard</i>), or its synonym <i>beguine</i> and derivative verb <i>beguigner</i>, <i>beguiner</i>, to act the beguin. The <i>Beghards</i> or <i>Beguines</i> were a lay mendicant order, and in the 13th century mendicants calling themselves by these names swarmed over Western Europe.

And give you all a toast--
