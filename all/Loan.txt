						We should mention that the equations for S loan photometric parallax and [F e/H ] would be signiﬁcantly better if an analysis were made purely from S loan data.

						We present a new formula for absolute magnitude determination for late-type dwarf stars as a function of (g − r) and (r − i) for S loan photometry.

						Karaali et al. (2003b) and Karaali, Bilir &amp; Tunc¸el (2005) calibrated the absolute magnitude offset with the U V -excess for different U BV colour-indices and they extended their work from U BV to S loan photometry.
