					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						In this paper, we report improvement in the accuracy of the control of the local transmission of the manufactured microdot prototype with a second-generation prototype (hereafter, Proto 2), and demonstrate improved performance.

										<div class="usage">
						In particular, we show that small-world random graphs built from underlying grid structures do not have strong improvement in hyperbolicity, even when the rewiring greatly improves decentralized navigation.

						On the Hyperbolicity of Small-World and Tree-Like Random Graphs
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						We show that permutations on blocks of random sequences improve their randomness. The improvement presented in the graphs is typical of the performance of d-sequences.

						Increasing Randomness Using Permutations on Blocks
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						Based on the performance study on the 2nd prototype, our aim towards the next prototype will be; to reduce power consumption, improve differential non-linearity and improve integral non-linearity.
