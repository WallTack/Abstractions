						Second, and more importantly, the Nash-Shapley model also illustrates the importance of defending against the bluff, which represents strength when one is in fact weak, via slow-playing, which represents weakness when one is in fact strong, via an ”optimal slow-playing frequency”.

										<div class="usage">
						There are four such functions and the two that survive the process of eliminating of dominated strategies are playing directly, that is passing when holding an L and betting when holding an H (denoted in the tables as s1 ), and running a possible bluff, i.e. betting holding an L or an H (denoted in the tables as s2 ). 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Quantized Poker
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						The poker lingo refers to this as snapping off player 3’s bluff and an early action player’s slowplaying strategy as sandbagging. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Quantized Poker
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						Note that attempting to snap off bluffs is not without risk, as player 3 may well pass out the hand when holding L and deny to players 1 or 2 their sure gain of at least half of players 3’s ante in the situation where at least one of players 1 and 2 bet holding H and player 3 holds L. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Quantized Poker
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						On the other hand, the rewards of successfully snapping off a bluff are great as if player 3 holding L does attempt a steal in response to a slowplay by one of players 1 or 2, he loses the maximum possible of an ante plus a bet to that player. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Quantized Poker
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						One can ask, just how often does this happen ? An easy application of Bayes’ Rule shows that in equilibrium the probability of at least one of players 1 and 2 is using his or her slowplaying strategy is about 28%, so player 3 can expect to have his bluffs snapped off a little more than a quarter of the time.
