Synonyms Priority, Antecedence, Precedence, Preëminence, Predominance, Preference, Superiority, Supremacy. Priority is the state or fact of coming first in order of time; what little use it has beyond this meaning is only a figurative extension. Antecedence is strictly priority, without any proper figurative use. Precedence may mean priority, but generally means the right to go or come first, the privilege of going before another: as, the question of precedence among sovereigns or ambassadors makes great trouble, because the dignity of the nations represented is supposed to be at stake. Preeminence is, figuratively, height by nature above all others, generally in some one respect: as, the preeminence of Shakspere as a dramatist. Predominance is superior and dominating power or influence: as, the predominance of a certain faction; figuratively, the predominance of light or shade or a particular color in a certain picture. Preference is the putting forward of a person or thing by choice, on the ground of worthiness, or on account of the taste, fancy, or arbitrary will of the one preferring: as, to give the preference to Milton over Dante. Superiority may refer to nature or to given or achieved position over others; it differs from supremacy as the comparative differs from the superlative degree: as, the superiority of the appearance of certain troops; the superiority of the dairy-products of a certain region: superiority to one's circumstances; supremacy on the land and supremacy on the sea do not always go together.
