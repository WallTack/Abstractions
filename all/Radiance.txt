These words agree in representing the shooting out of rays or beams in an Impressive way. Radiance is the most steady; it is generally a light that is agreeable to the eyes: hence the word is often chosen for corresponding figurative expressions: as, the radiance of his cheerfulness; the radiance of the gospel. Brilliance represents a light that is strong, often too strong to be agreeable, and marked by variation or play and penetration: as, the brilliance of a diamond or of fireworks. Hence, figuratively, the brilliancy of the scene at a wedding; the radiance of humor, the brilliancy of wit. Brilliance is more often literal, brilliancy figurative, Effulgence is a splendid light, seeming to fill to overflowing every place where it is—a strong, flooding, but not necessarily intense or painful light: as, the effulgence of the noonday sun; the effulgence of the attributes of God. Hence a courtier might by figure speak of the effulgence of Queen Elizabeth's beauty. Befulgence is often the same as effulgence, but sometimes weaker. Splendor, which is more often used figuratively is, when used literally, about the same as refulgence. Luster is the only one of these words which does not imply that the object gives forth light; luster may be used where the light is either emitted or reflected, but latterly more often reflected: as, the luster of silk. Luster is generally, like brilliance, a varying light, but it may be simply two or three degrees weaker than splendor. For comparison with glisten, glitter, etc., see glare, v. i.</span> </li>
