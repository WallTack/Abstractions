										Gerald Ford was the only President to have two women attempt to assassinate him. Both attempts were in California in September of 1975. The first attempt was September 6, 1975, by Lynette Fromme who thought she could impress Charles Manson by killing the President. The next attempt was by Sara Jane Moore on September 22, 1975. Her motive was simply that she was bored. John Tyler, joined the Confederacy twenty years later and became the only President named a sworn enemy of the United States.
