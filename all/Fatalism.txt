Fatalism is a doctrine which does not recognize the determination of all events by causes, in the ordinary sense; holding, on the contrary, that a certain foreordained result will come about, no matter what may be done to prevent it. Fatalism is thus directly opposed to necessitarianism, according to which every event is determined by the events which immediately precede it, in a mechanical way. Necessitarianism seems hardly to leave room for final causes, while fatalism is the doctrine that certain results are sure to come in spite of all that efficient causes may do to prevent them.
