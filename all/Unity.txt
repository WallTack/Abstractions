Thus, in the theory of matrices, the matrix of any order having all the constituents zero except those of the principal diagonal, which are all ones, is the unity of that order. In ordinary algebra one, or the unit of abstract number, is the only unity. Unit and unity are words frequently confused; but with accurate writers unit is the standard of measurement, that which is counted, and has no reference to multiplication; while unity has reference to multiplication alone. In a multiple associative algebra there are as many units as the ordinal number of the algebra, but there can be but one unity, and there need not be any at all.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">unity</span> <span class="exp">The principle by which a uniform tenor of story and propriety of representation is preserved in literary compositions; conformity in a composition to this principle; a reference to some one purpose or leading idea, or to the main proposition, in all the parts of a discourse or composition. The so-called Aristotelian law of unity of time, of place, and of action (called ‘the unities’) in a drama was the fundamental rule or general idea from which the French classical dramatic writers and critics derived, or to which they referred, all their practical rules for the construction of a drama. This law demanded that there should be no shifting of the scene from place to place, that the whole series of events should be such as might occur within the space of a single day, and that nothing should be admitted irrelevant to the development of the single plot.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">unity</span> <span class="exp">In artistic creations, a combination of parts such as to constitute a whole or to exhibit a form of symmetry in style and character; the quality of any work by which all the parts are subordinate to or promotive of one general design or effect.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">unity</span> <span class="exp">In law: The holding of the same estate in undivided shares by two or more; joint tenancy.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">unity</span> <span class="exp">The joint possession by one person of two rights by several titles.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">unity</span> <span class="exp">A gold coin of the reign of James I.
