						We will show below that the MAXQ method provides a value function representation and learning algorithm that supports temporal abstraction, state abstraction, and subtask sharing.

						For each condition, we give a deﬁnition and then prove a lemma which states that if the condition is satisﬁed, then the value function for some corresponding class of policies can be represented abstractly (i.e., by abstract versions of the V and C functions).
