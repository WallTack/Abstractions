										<div class="usage">
						This can be used to form a common message and common randomness to reduce the second coding problem to the ﬁrst one.

										<div class="usage">
						As the senders have a common message and as the second part of the paper deals with the wiretap MAC with conferencing encoders, we assume that the encoders have access to a restricted amount of common randomness.
