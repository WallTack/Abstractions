The right of the state to control the means of production, and also the distribution and consumption of the products of industry, is in general especially emphasized by the advocates of the theory. In some communistic schemes the right of the individual to the control of his own labor is also denied, each one being required to do that which is most advantageous to the community as a whole. Such theories, differing in details, have frequently been advanced—by Plato in his “Republic,” by Sir Thomas More in his “Utopia,” and in recent times by many writers—and have not infrequently been carried into execution on a small scale, as in the Oneida Community.
