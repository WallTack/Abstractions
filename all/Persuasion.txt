Opinion has the least feeling or energy, is most inellectual. Belief may be purely intellectual, or largely moral by the consent of the feelings or the will. Persuasion is a word borrowed from the field of action; primarily, we persuade one to do something by motives addressed to his feelings or interests; when the word is applied to opinions, it seems to retain much of its original sense, suggesting that the persuasioh is founded largely on the feelings or wishes: we have a pesuasion of that which we are willing to believe. Conviction starts from the other side, primarily suggesting that one was rather reluctantly forced to belive by the weight of evidance; it is now more often used of settled, profound, amd earnest beliefs: as, his deepest convictions of right and duty. Faith rests upon belief, but implies confidence in a person on whose authority one depends at least partly, and the gathering of feeling about the opinion held; it is a confident belief: as, to have implict faith in a friend or a promise.
