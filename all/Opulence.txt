All these words imply not only the possession of much property, but the possession of it under such circumstances that it can be and is enjoyed. They seem contrasted not only with theīr opposites, but with the possession of a moderate amount. Opulence is a dignified and strong word for wealth. Wealth and riches may mean the property possessed, and riches generally does mean it; the others do not. Affluence suggests the flow of wealth to one, and resulting free expenditure for objects of desire. There is little difference in the strength of the words.</span> </li>
