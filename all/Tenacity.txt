Tenacity results from the attraction of cohesion which exists between the particles of bodies, and the stronger this attraction is in any body the greater is the tenacity of the body. Tenacity is consequently different in different materials, and in the same material it varies with the state of the body in regard to temperature and other circumstances. The resistance offered to tearing is called absolute tenacity, that offered to crushing retroactive tenacity. The tenacity of wood is much greater in the direction of the length of its fibers than in the transverse direction. With regard to metals, the processes of forging and wire-drawing increase their tenacity in the longitudinal direction; and mixed metals have, in general, greater tenacity than those which are simple.
