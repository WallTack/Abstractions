						To build some intuition about these rates, one should also consider the “maximally timid strategy” where one chooses the ﬁrst observation that falls in [0, 0.5], then one chooses the next observation that falls in [0.5, 1], and then the next that falls in [0, 0.5], and so on.

						It seems that in the Physics research it was taken for granted that convergence was not an issue: atomic spectra were studied via PT and early authoritative warnings were simply disregarded (for instance, explicit by Einstein, in , and clear, in , but “timid” being too far against the mainstream, for his young age).

						Large-scale testing problems certainly look complicated enough, but this is deceptive; their massively parallel structure, with thousands of similar situations each providing information, allows an appropriate prior distribution to be estimated from the data without upsetting even timid frequentists like myself.
