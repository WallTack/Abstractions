									<li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">attachment</span> <span class="exp">The act of attaching; specifically, in law, a taking of the person, goods, or estate by a writ or precept in a civil action, to secure a debt or demand, or to compel to appear in court, or to punish for contempt. In American usage, attachment, when used in reference to property, means the taking of the defendant's property into custody by the law, by a summary process from a court, in advance of the trial of the merits of the case, as security for the payment of any judgment that may be recovered. The grounds of granting it are usually evidence of fraud or fraudulent disposal of property, or apprehension of absconding, etc. When used in reference to the person, it means the taking of the person into custody to answer to a charge of contempt of court. Foreign attachment is the taking, from the hands or control of a third person within the jurisdiction, of the money or goods or rights of action of a debtor who is not within the jurisdiction. Any person who has goods or effects of a debtor is considered in law as the agent, attorney, factor, or trustee of the debtor; and an attachment served on such person binds the property in his hands to respond to the judgment against the debtor. The process of foreign attachment has existed from time immemorial in London, Bristol, Exeter, Lancaster, and some other towns in England, and by the Common Law Procedure Act of 1854 has been made general. It is also sometimes known as garnishment, in Scotland as arrestment, and in New England as trustee process.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">attachment</span> <span class="exp">The writ or process directing the person or estate of a person to be taken, for the purposes above stated.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">attachment</span> <span class="exp">The act or state of being attached, fastened on, or connected.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">attachment</span> <span class="exp">Close adherence or affection; regard; any passion or affection that binds a person to another person or to a thing.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">attachment</span> <span class="exp">That which attaches one thing to another, or a person to an object: as, the attachments of a muscle; the attachments of home.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">attachment</span> <span class="exp">That which is attached to a principal object; an adjunct: as, the æolian attachment to the piano; an attachment to a sewing-machine.</span> </li>
