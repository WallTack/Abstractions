						Ogilvie (2001) demonstrated that a Navier-Stokes shear viscosity alone results in an overstability of the 2D disc, and since we wish to consider damping of eccentricity, we work with a bulk viscosity rather than a shear term. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						The dynamics of eccentric accretion discs in superhump systems
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						Therefore the perturbed ﬂow can still be described as an eccentricity, now governed by a new eccentricity equation. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						The dynamics of eccentric accretion discs in superhump systems
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						The dynamical term simply describes a precession of the eccentricity which also satisﬁes equation (34). 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						The dynamics of eccentric accretion discs in superhump systems
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						The term in the eccentricity gradient can be integrated by parts and, with the boundary conditions we use below, the boundary term vanishes and we obtain expressions containing integrals of real quantities only. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						The dynamics of eccentric accretion discs in superhump systems
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						The two terms in the imaginary part behave as expected, with the resonant forcing acting to increase eccentricity and the bulk viscosity damping it (a negative eigenvalue implies a growing eccentricity). 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						The dynamics of eccentric accretion discs in superhump systems
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						Equation (37) is simply another form of the general relation for eccentricity growth and decay expressed by equation (35), in terms of a growth-rate eigenvalue. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						The dynamics of eccentric accretion discs in superhump systems
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						The overall equation for the eccentricity can be simpliﬁed by considering a narrow ring centred on the 3:1 Lindblad resonance. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						The dynamics of eccentric accretion discs in superhump systems
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						This is helpful because the equation now has an analytical solution and the behaviour of the eccentricity can be examined directly. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						The dynamics of eccentric accretion discs in superhump systems
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						We solve the equations in a ring extending between x = −a and x = b, with the boundary conditions that the eccentricity gradient is zero at the edges of the ring. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						The dynamics of eccentric accretion discs in superhump systems

										<div class="usage">
						With no resonance, the eccentricity distributions are simple cosine waves. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						The dynamics of eccentric accretion discs in superhump systems
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						When the resonance is added a cusp develops at the resonance point in the centre of the ring, with a discontinuity in the eccentricity gradient. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						The dynamics of eccentric accretion discs in superhump systems
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						As the resonance is made stronger the cusp becomes deeper and the wavenumber closer to the value where the eccentricity has a zero at the resonant point. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						The dynamics of eccentric accretion discs in superhump systems
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						The eccentricity of narrow rings with different resonant strengths, showing the development of the cusp as W increases. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						The dynamics of eccentric accretion discs in superhump systems
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						This counterintuitive behaviour arises because of the cusp, which, as shown by Fig. 1, deepens as the growth rate increases and leads to a low eccentricity at the resonant point. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						The dynamics of eccentric accretion discs in superhump systems
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						Since the eccentricity growth here is proportional to the eccentricity itself, a low eccentricity slows the growth of the instability and allows the eccentricity to be damped away in the disc.
