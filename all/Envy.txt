Jealousy is the malign feeling which is often had toward a rival, or possible rival, for the possession of that which we greatly desire, as in love or ambition. Envy is a similar feeling toward one, whether rival or not, who already possesses that which we greatly desire. Jealousy is enmity prompted by fear; envy is enmity prompted by covetousness.</span> </li><li><span class="term">envy</span> <span class="exp">To regard with envy; look upon as the possessor of what is wanting in or to one's self, with a longing for it, and either with or without, a desire for the deprivation or discomfiture of him who has it: often with both the possessor and the thing possessed as objects. The verb often expresses a much milder feeling than that which is usually denoted by the noun—one that may be consistent with perfect friendship and loyalty: as, I envy you your good health; I envy you your happy temper. But the feeling of envy is apt to beget repugnance and ill will, and some degree of these qualities is generally implied by the verb as well as by the noun.</span> </li><li><span class="term">envy</span> <span class="exp">To feel envy on account of; regard grudgingly or wistfully another's possession or experience of, either with or without malevolent feeling.</span> </li><li><span class="term">envy</span> <span class="exp">To regard unfavorably; revolt against; oppose.</span> </li><li><span class="term">envy</span> <span class="exp">To do harm to; injure.</span> </li><li><span class="term">envy</span> <span class="exp">To be affected with envy; have envious feelings; regard something pertaining to another with grudge or longing: formerly often followed by at.</span> </li><li><span class="term">envy</span> <span class="exp">To challenge (in a game).</span> </li><li><span class="term">envy</span> <span class="exp">To vie with; emulate.</span> </li><li><span class="term">envy</span> <span class="exp">To strive; contend; vie.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">envy</span> <span class="exp">A challenge (in a game); a vying; a vie.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">envy</span> <span class="exp">A contention; an attempt; an attack.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">envy</span> <span class="exp">Emulation.</span> </li>
