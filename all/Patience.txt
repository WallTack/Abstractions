Patience is by derivation a virtue of suffering, but it is also equally an active virtue, as patience in industry, application, teaching. Passively, it is gentle, serene, self-possessed, without yielding its ground or repining; actively, it adds to so much of this spirit as may be appropriate to the situation a steady, watchful, untiring industry and faithfulness. Fortitude is the passive kind of patience, joined with notable courage. In endurance attention is directed to the fact of bearing labor, pain, contumely, etc., without direct implication as to the moral qualities required or shown. Resignation implies the voluntary submission of the will to a personal cause of affliction or loss; it is a high word, generally looking up to God as the controller of human life. Resignation is thus generally a submission or meekness, giving up or resigning personal desires to the will of God.</span> </li>
