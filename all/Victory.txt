The subject is a very frequent one in ancient art, from some of the noblest of antique sculpture down to vase-paintings and figurines. Among the most notable examples are the reliefs from the balustrade of the temple of Wingless Victory at Athens, one of which is the well-known figure entitled “Victory Loosing her Sandal,” and the magnificent statue called the “Victory of Samothrace,” a Greek original of the fourth century B. C, attributed to the school of Scopas, found in the island of Samothrace, where it stood on a pedestal representing the prow of a trireme, and now one of the chief ornaments of the Louvre Museum.
