It denotes any general notion considered as resulting from the action of memory upon experiences more or less similar. Such a notion is called an anticipation because, once possessed, it is called up in its entirety by a mere suggestion. It thus acquaints us with what has not yet been perceived, by a reference to past perceptions. Hence, with later philosophers, the word denotes knowledge drawn from the mind, independently of experience; the knowledge of axioms or first principles. With Bacon an anticipation of nature is a hasty generalization or hypothesis: opposed to an interpretation of nature. In Kant's philosophy, anticipation is the a priori knowledge that every sensation must have degrees of intensive quantity.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">anticipation</span> <span class="exp">In medicine, the occurrence in the human body of any phenomenon, morbid or natural, before the usual time.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">anticipation</span> <span class="exp">In music, the introduction into a chord of one or more of the component notes of the chord which follows, producing a passing discord.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">anticipation</span> <span class="exp">In rhetoric, prolepsis.
