									<li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">essence</span> <span class="exp">The inward nature, true substance, or constitution of anything. The Greek οὐσία (see the etymology) denotes a subject in esse, something whose mode of being corresponds to that of a subject, as distinguished from a predicate, in speech. But while this is the original conception, the word essence, even in Latin, usually carries a different sense. The essence is rather the idea of a thing, the law of its being, that which makes it the kind of thing that it is, that which is expressed in its definition. In regard to artificial things, the conception of an essence is usually tolerably clear; thus, the essence of a bottle is that it should be a vessel with a tubular orifice. Those philosophers who speak of the essences of natural things hold that natural kinds are regulated by similar ideas. Nominalists hold that definitions do not belong to things, but to words; and accordingly they speak of the essences of words, meaning what is directly implied in their definitions.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">essence</span> <span class="exp">Hence The distinctive characteristic; that which is expressed by the definition of any term: as, the essence of a miser's character is avarice.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">essence</span> <span class="exp">That part of anything which gives it its individual character or quality: as, this summary contains the essence of the book.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">essence</span> <span class="exp">Existence; being.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">essence</span> <span class="exp">An elementary ingredient or constituent; anything uncompounded: as, the fifth essence (that is, the fifth element in the philosophy of Aristotle, or the upper air, the other four being, in their order, earth, water, air, and fire).
