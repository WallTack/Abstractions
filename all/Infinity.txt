Owing to the mechanical properties of the straight line, the most important mode of geometrical transformation is that which transforms every straight line into a straight line, its position only being changed. But this transforms the part of space at infinity into a plane, just as in a perspective view of an unbounded plane the infinitely distant parts are compressed into a line. Hence, mathematicians generally speak of the plane at infinity, or the line at infinity in a plane. In analytical geometry the plane at infinity is best considered as two coincident planes, fastened together at an imaginary nodal circle, and constituting a degenerate sphere, called the sphere at infinity. (See absolute, n., 2.) In the theory of functions, the most important mode of transformation of the plane is one which preserves the magnitudes of all angles, and this transforms the infinitely distant parts of the plane into a point; hence, in that branch of mathematics, the point at infinity is spoken of.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">infinity</span> <span class="exp">An infinite number: as, an infinity of straight lines.
