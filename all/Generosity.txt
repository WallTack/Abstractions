						The technics and results here will be substantial adaptations and generalizations from [19, 20] in the ﬁnite Morley rank case, and our arguments for Cartan and Carter subgroups of groups deﬁnable in o-minimal structure will highly depend on dimensional computations and generosity arguments.

						Now, since Q◦ ≤ N (aQ◦ ) ≤ N (Q◦ ) and dim(Q◦ ) = dim(N (Q◦ )), we get that dim([aQ◦ ]0 ) = dim(N (aQ◦ )), and Corollary 17 gives the weak generosity of aQ◦ .
