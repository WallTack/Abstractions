						For the sake of completeness we also describe the universal (Bohr) compactiﬁcation and universal G-ambit in model-theoretic terms, when G is a topological group (although it is essentially well-known). 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						On compactifications and the topological dynamics of definable groups
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						Let us note immediately that a compactiﬁcation of the topological group G is a special case of continuous action of G on a compact space X , where X has a distinguished point x0 with dense orbit under G (a so-called G-ambit.) Again there is a universal G-ambit.

						For the more general case of G-ﬂows, the explication of the universal G-ambit via the Samuel compactiﬁcation of G (, ), with respect to the right uniformity on G, is basically equivalent to the model-theoretic account that we give below.

						There is a universal G-ambit, sometimes called S (G), with distinguished point e say: for every G-ﬂow (X, G) and p ∈ X there is a unique map of G-ﬂows from S (G) to X which takes e to p.
