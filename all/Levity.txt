Levity, Volatility, Flightiness, Frivolity, Lightness. All these words are founded upon the idea of the lack of physical and, by figure, of mental and moral substance or weight, with a resulting ease in flying away from what is wise. The first three refer especially to outward conduct. Levity is a want of seriousness, temporary or habitual, a disposition to trifle with important interests. Volatility is that moral defect by which one cannot dwell long upon any one object of thought, or turns quickly from one source of pleasure to another: the word does not convey much opprobrium; in the young some degree of volatility is expected. Flightiness borders upon the loss of sanity in caprice or excitement of fancy; it is volatility in an extreme degree. Frivolity is a matter of nature, an inability to care about any but the most petty and trifling things. Lightness is not so strong as frivolity, but covers nearly the same ground; it emphasizes inconstancy.</span> </li>
