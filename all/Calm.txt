All the italicized words, when applied to the mind, still suggest the physical phenomena which they primarily denote. Calm implies that the mind remains unagitated, even by care and anxiety. There is a tendency to use the word to express the most complete mastery of the emotions; but it is also used for the mere outward manner: as, in spite of his anger, he remained calm. Placid is by derivation associated with the notion of pleasure; it generally applies to that which belongs to the nature, but is also especially used of the face: as, a placid smile. Tranquil implies not so much a mastery of self amid disturbing circumstances as freedom from that which agitates, a settled calm. Serene, by its association with the aspects of the sky, implies an exalted calm, a tranquillity that rises above clouds or storms. Quiet, when applied to the disposition, implies that the person is naturally silent and undemonstrative; externally it implies that one is free from annoyances: as, to leave him in quiet. Like tranquil, but unlike the rest, it is not suggestive of a triumph of self-control over natural agitation of feelings or confusion of mind. Cool is the opposite of heated; it indicates that state in which the heat of feeling is perfectly kept down, so that the intellectual faculties are not hindered from their best operation. Composed is applicable to the state of both thoughts and feelings, while collected, gathered together, can be used only with reference to the thoughts. Composed differs from collected also in expressing, like calm, merely a frame of mind; while collected, like cool, expresses a readiness for action with the full and unimpeded force of the mind.

										Methylphenidate (Ritalin) is a medication prescribed for individuals (usually children) who have an abnormally high level of activity or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). According to the National Institute of Mental Health, about 3 to 5 percent of the general population has the disorder, which is characterized by agitated behavior and an inability to focus on tasks. Methylphenidate also is occasionally prescribed for treating narcolepsy. Methylphenidate is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. It has effects similar to, but more potent than, caffeine and less potent than amphetamines. It has a notably calming effect on hyperactive children and a "focusing" effect on those with ADHD.
