										Charles Dodgson, also known as Lewis Carroll, wrote "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" after Alice Pleasance Liddell. It was to be believed he fell in love with her and asked the parents if he could some day marry her. The parents disconnected their friendship. Alice Liddell has 12 letters, as does the pen name Lewis Carroll. It's a coincidence he uses 2 r's where the 2 d's are, as with the 2 L's.

										<div class="usage">
						We used 10-fold cross validation in our experiments: For each of 10 runs of all of the recommender approaches that we compare, we leave out one tenth of the friendship relations and use the remaining nine tenth of the friendship relations to compute FoF Recommendations. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Interest-Based vs. Social Person-Recommenders in Social Networking Platforms
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						We then compute the n = 10 best recommendations for each user and each approach and measure how many of the deleted one tenth friendship relations are “reproduced” by the recommender. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Interest-Based vs. Social Person-Recommenders in Social Networking Platforms
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						If the random 10-fold partitioning of the friendship relations deletes less than 1 or more than 10 friendship relations for a single user, we do not compute recommendations for this user. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Interest-Based vs. Social Person-Recommenders in Social Networking Platforms
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						What we see from the table is that the interest based recommender approach is signiﬁcantly better than random in reproducing pre-existing friendships. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Interest-Based vs. Social Person-Recommenders in Social Networking Platforms
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						This can be attributed to the fact that even in a platform that is mainly targeted towards exchange of content in view of a narrower ﬁeld of interest (a typical community of interest ), friendship relations are perceived mainly as something social and not so much as something content or interest related. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Interest-Based vs. Social Person-Recommenders in Social Networking Platforms
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						The formation of social friendship ties will obviously be strongly inﬂuenced by the friend of a friend effect and can thus much more easily be reproduced by the FoF recommender. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Interest-Based vs. Social Person-Recommenders in Social Networking Platforms
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						However, it has to be stressed that, as discussed before, the performance with respect to reproducing existing friendship ties is certainly not our main goal and not the only quality criterion of an interest based person recommender in our sense. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Interest-Based vs. Social Person-Recommenders in Social Networking Platforms

						For instance, there may exist several networks like friendship network, collaboration network, organizational network, etc. on the same set of nodes. A way to look at the problem under consideration is that, we focus on one such network at a time and derive conditions so that it has the desired topology or structure. 
					</div>
					<div class="uAuthor">
						Sufficient Conditions for Formation of a Network Topology by Self-interested Agents
