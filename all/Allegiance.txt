Every citizen owes allegiance to the government under which he is born. Natural or implied allegiance is that obligation which one owes to the nation of which he is a natural-born citizen or subject so long as he remains such, and it does not arise from any express promise. Express allegiance is that obligation which proceeds from an express promise or oath of fidelity. Local or temporary allegiance is due from an alien to the government or state under or in which he resides. In the United States the paramount allegiance of a citizen has been decided to be due to the general government, and not to the government of the particular State in which he is domiciled.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">allegiance</span> <span class="exp">Hence Observance of obligation in general; fidelity to any person or thing; devotion.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">allegiance</span> <span class="exp">Synonyms Allegiance, Loyalty, Fealty.
