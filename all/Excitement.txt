										In the 19th century, craftsmen who made hats were known to be excitable and irrational, as well as to tremble with palsy and mix up their words. Such behavior gave rise to the familiar expression "mad as a hatter". The disorder, called hatter's shakes, was caused by chronic mercury poisoning from the solution used to treat the felt. Attacking the central nervous system, the toxin led to behavioral symptoms.

						The measured transition energies for perpendicular excitations were blue-shifted compared to the qualitative values predicted within a single-particle theory. The results indicate a smaller exciton binding energy for perpendicular excitations than for parallel excitations.

						Cross-polarized optical absorption of single-walled nanotubes probed by polarized photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy

										<div class="usage">
						In contrast to this inadequacy to deal with the radial excitations and the strong model dependence of the conﬁgurations for higher (second and up) excitations, our dynamics provides a very simple picture for the ﬁrst non-radial excitations that follows the trend of data.

										<div class="usage">
						Quenching of the lower excited states of the electrons will be particularly effective in the presence of a resonance between the energy of excited electron and the energy of electron excitation in the ion (in the limit, most favorable case — ionization energy).
