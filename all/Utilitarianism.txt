Utilitarianism originated with the marquis Cesare Bonesana Beccaria (1735-93), but its great master was Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832). He held that the sole possible rational motive is the expectation of pleasure, as measured by the intensity, propinquity, and duration of the pleasure, and the strength of the expectation. Utilitarian ethics, however, does not insist that such considerations need or ought to determine action in special cases, but only that the rules of morals should be founded upon them. These views greatly, and advantageously, influenced ethical thought and legislation in France, England, and the United States.</span> </li>
