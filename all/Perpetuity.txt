Pollock. The evils incident to rendering any specific piece of land or fund inalienable, and thus shutting it out from the general circulation of property, early led the courts to hold provisions for a perpetual suspension of the power of alienation to be void. The desire of owners of estates to perpetuate the wealth of the family led to attempts to create forfeitures and gifts over to other persons, by way of shielding the successor in the title from temptation to alienate; and as the right to create life-estates and trusts, and to add gifts over to other persons upon the termination of precedent estates, could not be wholly denied, the question has been what temporary suspension of the power of alienation is reasonable and allowable, and what is too remote and to be held void as “tending to create a perpetuity.” (See remoteness.) The limit now generally established for this purpose in varying forms is substantially to the effect that no disposition of real property or creation of an estate therein is valid if it suspends the absolute power of alienation for more than a period measured by a life or lives in being plus 21 years and 9 months. Hence, since literal perpetuities are no longer known, except in the law of charities, etc., the phrase rule against perpetuities has come to mean in ordinary usage the rule against future estates which are void for remoteness as “tending to create a perpetuity.”</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">perpetuity</span> <span class="exp">Duration to all futurity; exemption from intermission or ceasing.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">perpetuity</span> <span class="exp">In the doctrine of annuities, the number of years in which the simple interest of any principal sum will amount to the same as the principal itself; or the number of years' purchase to be given for an annuity which is to continue forever; also, the annuity itself.</span> </li>
