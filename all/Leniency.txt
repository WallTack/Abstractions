Clemency is exercised only toward offenders, being especially the attribute of those in exalted places having power to remit or lighten penalty. Leniency, as a word, is much more common and expressive than lenity; leniency or lenity may be practised by any one having authority to lighten or remit penalty or to excuse from tasks: as, the leniency of a judge, a parent, or a teacher. Mercy has a twofold use, expressing clemency toward offenders or great kindness toward the distressed; in either sense it is a strong word.</span> </li>
