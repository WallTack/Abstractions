						Our conventions for the Ma jorana fermions are as follows: we choose the Ma jorana representation in which the fermions are real, i. e. Ψ†M = ΨT M (transpose here also includes the color indices to simplify the notation).

						We can check that the action is real if we use the following complex conjugation convention for spinors, (ψξ )∗ = ξ ∗ψ ∗ .

						This convention implies that the product of two real fermions is imaginary, and this is the reason for the extra factors of i in the action.

						The basic ideas of the quantization of free Weyl fermions and the underlying geometry is discussed in the paper of Bowick and Ra jeev , but we would like to expand on it and there are some differences in our conventions.

						III, ǫ(p, q ) = −sgn(p)δ [p − q ] (here the minus sign is crucial, in our previous works that was not important, but in the super case there is a prefered choice) and we also employ the product convention as before for example (F C )(p, s) = R [dq ]F (p, q )C (q , s).
