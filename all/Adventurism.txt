										Charles Dodgson, also known as Lewis Carroll, wrote "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" after Alice Pleasance Liddell. It was to be believed he fell in love with her and asked the parents if he could some day marry her. The parents disconnected their friendship. Alice Liddell has 12 letters, as does the pen name Lewis Carroll. It's a coincidence he uses 2 r's where the 2 d's are, as with the 2 L's.
