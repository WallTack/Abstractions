[In early writers the meaning is influenced by the sixth book of Aristotle's “Nicomachæan Ethics,” where this word was used to translate σοφία, defined by Aristotle as the union of science, or demonstrative knowledge, with nous, or cognition of principles. Aristotle also applies it to the knowledge of a master of any art. But in scholastic writings it usually means knowledge of the most difficult subjects, metaphysics, theology, thus again translating σοφία].</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">sapience</span> <span class="exp">The reasonable soul; the intellective faculty; that which distinguishes men from brutes; reason.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">sapience</span> <span class="exp">The sense of taste, or intelligence compared to taste.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">sapience</span> <span class="exp">The apocryphal Book of Wisdom.</span> </li>
