As a principle active in the historical changes of language, euphony is a misnomer, since it is ease of utterance, economy of effort on the part of the organs of speech, and not agreeableness to the ear, that leads to and governs such changes.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">euphony</span> <span class="exp">Harmonious arrangement of sounds in composition; a smooth and agreeable combination of articulate elements in any piece of writing.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">euphony</span> <span class="exp">Synonyms Euphony, Melody, Harmony, Rhythm. Euphony in style respects simply the question of pleasing sounds in the words themselves. Melody respects the succession of sounds, especially as affected by the pitch appropriate to the thought and required by the arrangement of clauses. Harmony respects the adaptation of sound to sense. Rhythm respects the emphasis—that is, the succession of emphatic and unemphatic syllables. In music melody respects the agreeable combination of successive sounds of various pitch, while harmony respects the agreeable blending of simultaneous sounds of different pitch, the sounds in either case being from voices or musical instruments; thus, a song for children to sing must depend for its effect upon melody rather than harmony.</span> </li>
