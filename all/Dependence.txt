						This implies that Frs depends at most on urs and pr . A similar argument shows that Frs may depend at most on urs and qr , therefore it depends only on urs .

						Based on the Regge model with cuts, the energy dependence of such contributions are estimated for two spin-dependent terms: 1) the total spin dependent term, σ1 , 2) the spin pro jection dependent term, σ2 .

						But, we now used the wavevector-dependent coherent interlayer tunneling similar to that suggested by Liechtenstein et al. We note that this wavevector-dependent interlayer tunneling gives rise to a stronger φ0 dependence of Ic than does the constant, wavevector-independent tunneling model.

						However, the sum of the terms on the second and third lines may also contribute to the atomic sum rule, as they depend on εν . [This dependence is cancelled by the εν dependence of the radial integral brought about by φl (εν , r) in (5).

						However, it is signiﬁcant that the dependences agree—although the dependence on the energy and the volume is dictated by scaling arguments (this is a conformally invariant theory), the dependence on N is not.
