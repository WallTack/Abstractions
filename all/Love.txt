As between persons, love is the most general of these words, covering much the widest range, both in degree and in kind. Liking is the weakest. Predilection goes a little further, but is only a preparatory liking or readiness to love. Attachment has much of the notion implied in its derivation; it is a love that binds one to another, an unwillingness to be separated. Affection is generally a regulated and conscious love or attachment; it goes deeper than attachment. Attachment and especially affection are often the refined and mellowed fruit of the passion of love. Fondness, originally a foolish tenderness, is not yet altogether redeemed from that idea; it may be an unreasoning and doting attachment, and is never very high in quality. Devotion is a sort of consecration or dedication to the object of one's feeling, an intense loyalty, as to a superior—a constant service.
