Especially, in architecture, the exact or geometrical repetition of one half of any structure or composition by the other half, only with the parts arranged in reverse order, as notably in much Renaissance and modern architecture—for instance, in the placing of two spires, exact duplicates of each other, on the front of a church.

Symmetry in this sense is something more and other than that due proportion of parts noted in def. 1, since it implies a geometrical representation approximately as in def. 2 (see promorphology); it is also to be distinguished from mere metamerism, or the serial repetition of like parts conceived to face one way and not in opposite directions; but it coincides in some cases with actinomerism, and in others with antimerism or platetropy (see antimere, platetrope). Several sorts of symmetry are recognized. One is radial or actinomeric, in which like parts are arranged about an axis, from which they radiate like the parts of a flower, as in many zoöphytes and echinoderms; but such symmetry is unusual in the animal kingdom, being mainly confined to some of the lower classes of invertebrates, and even in these the departures from it are frequently obvious. (See bivium, trivium, and cuts under echinopædium and Spatangoidea.) The tendency of animal form on the whole being to grow along one main axis (the longitudinal), with symmetrical duplication of parts on each side of the vertical plane (the meson) passing through that axis, it follows that the usual symmetry is bilateral (see below). This is exhibited only obscurely, however, by some cylindrical organisms, as worms, whose right and left “sides,” though existent, are not well marked; and to such symmetry of ringed or annulose forms the term zonal is sometimes-applied. When the ordinary metameric divisions of any animal, as a vertebrate or an arthropod, are conceived as not simply serial but also as antitropic, such disposition of parts is regarded as constituting anteroposterior symmetry, in which parts are supposed to be reversed repetitions of each other on opposite sides of an imaginary plane dividing the body transversely to its axis, in the same sense that right and left parts are reversed repetitions of each other in bilateral symmetry. The existence of the last is denied or ignored by those who consider the segments of an articulate or vertebrate body as simply serially homologous; but in the view of those who recognize it the back of the arm corresponds to the front of the thigh, the convexity of the elbow (backward) to the convexity of the knee (forward), the extensor brachii to the extensor cruris, etc. Anteroposterior symmetry is also recognized by some naturalists in certain arthropods from the arrangements of the legs (in amphipods, for example), the correspondences observed between anal and oral parts, etc. Since any body is a solid, and therefore may be intersected by three mutually perpendicular planes, two of which are concerned in bilateral and anteroposterior symmetry respectively, a kind of symmetry called dorsabdominal symmetry is recognized by some, being that of parts lying upon opposite sides of a longitudinal horizontal plane passing through the axis of the body, as that between the neural and hemal arches of a vertebra; but it is generally obscure, and probably never perfect. Bilateral symmetry (see eudipleural) is the nearly universal rule in vertebrates and articulates. The chief departures from it in vertebrates are in the family of flatfishes or flounders (as the plaice, turbot, halibut), in parts of the cranium of various cetaceans and the single great tusk of the narwhal, in the skulls (especially the ear-parts) of sundry owls, in the beak of a plover (Anarhynchus) which is bent sidewise, in the atrophy of one of the ovaries and oviducts in most birds, and in the position finally assumed by the heart and great vessels and most of the digestive organs of vertebrates at large. (See cuts under asymmetry, narwhal, plaice, and plover.) In articulates notable exceptions to it are seen in the difference between the great claws or chelæ of a lobster, etc. In Mollusca asymmetry is the rule rather than the exception. (See Anisopleura, Isopleura.) A certain symmetry, apart from that exhibited by an animal body as a whole, may be also predicated of the several components of any part in their respective selves: as, the symmetry of a carpus or of a tarsus whose several bones are regularly disposed on each side of its axial plane, or around a central bone. (See cuts under carpus and tarsus.)</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">symmetry</span> <span class="exp">In moderu crystallography crystals are not only referred to certain systems (see crystallography) according to the relative lengths and inclinations of their assumed axes, but they are also further divided into classes, or groups, according to the kind and number of symmetry elements they possess. The symmetry elements are plane symmetry, axial symmetry, and centrosymmetry. A crystal has plune symmetry, or is symmetrical with reference to a certain plaue, when every face, edge, and solid angle has a like face, edge, and solid angle similarly situated on the opposite side of this plane; or, in other words, when this plane divides the crystal into halves each of which is the mirror image of the other. A cube of galena has three like planes of symmetry parallel to and midway between each pair of opposite faces; it has also six other plants of symmetry, like among themselves, passing through each pair of opposite edges. A crystal has axial symmetry, or is symmetrical with reference to a certain line as an axis when the faces, edges, and solid angles are similarly placed about this line so that if the crystal be revolved through a certain angle about this axis all its parts again occupy the same position in space; this angle must be either one half (180), one third (120°), one fourth (90°), or one sixth (60°) of a complete revolution. If the angle is 180, or the crystal repeats itself twice in a complete revolution, it has twofold or binary symnietry and the axis is called a dyad axis; if 120°, or the crystal repeats itself three times, the symmetry is threefold or ternury and the axis is a triad axis; if 90, or the crystal repeats itself four times, the symmetry is fourfold. 'quaternury, or tetrugonal, and the axis is tetrad axis; if 60°, or the crystal repeats itself six times, the symmetry is sixfold and the axis is a hexad axis. As already implied, fivefold symmetry, corresponding to a revolution of 72° about a heptad axis, is impossible among crystals. Symmetry with reference to a dyad axis is further distinguished as digonal or di-digonal, according to whether oue pair or two pairs of like symmetry planes intersect in it. Similarly the symmetry with reference to a triad axis may be trigonal or ditrigonal, accordiug to whether one or two sets of three like symmetry planes intersect in it; tetrugonal and ditetragonal symmetry with reference to a tetrad axis, also hexagonal and dihexagonal symmetry with reference to a hexad axis, are similarly distinguished. Further, axial symmetry is sometimes distinguished (H. A. Miers) as polar, alternating, holoaxial, and equatorial. It is;polar(also called hemimorphic, or acleistous (W. J. Lewis))when there is no plane of symmetry normal to the symmetry axis. It is alternating when each pair of faces at an extremity of a crystal may be brought symmetrically above a similar pair at the other by a revolution of 60°, and yet the horizontal plane is not a symmetry plane. It is holoaxial when all the possible axes of symmetry are present but no planes of symmetry. It is equatorial if a plane of symmetry is normal to the axis of symmetry. Still further, a symmetry axis which is the only one of its kind, and one in which two or more symmetry planes intersect, is called a principal axis and a symmetry plane normal to it is a principal plane. A crystal has centrosgmmetry when its faces, edges, and solid angles are symmetrical with reference to a central point; in other words, when every point on the surface of it has a similar point at an equal distance and on the opposite side from the center; this is true of ordinary triclinic crystals, as those of axinite. Entire want of symmetry, or asymmetry, is characteristic of one class of crystals only, belonging to the triclinic system. Symmetry classes or symmetry groups Theoretical discussion has shown that all the possible types of crystals are included in thirty-two classes or groups; of these, twenty-three are represented among crystallized minerals and six more among crystallized artificial salts. As shown below, two of the symmetry groups belong to the triclinic system, three to the monoclinic system, three to the orthorhombic system, seven to the trigonal division of the hexagonal system (sometimes called the trigonal system), five to the hexagonal division (the hexagonal system proper), seven to the tetragonal system, and five to the isometric system. The thirty-two symmetry classes have been differently named by different authors. One method is to name each class after that form in it which has the general symbol (hkl), after Miller(see symbol1, 2), as the hexoctahedral class of the isometric system; another method is to name each class after some prominent mineral species belonging to it, as the galena class or galena type. That class under each system which has the highest degree of symmetry and consequently the maximum number of faces belonging to a given form is often called the holosymmetric (of normal) class (holosymmetric' here corresponds to the term ‘holohedral’ formerly in use). Each of the other classes of the system has a special grade of symmetry peculiar to itself and lower than that of the holosymmetric class, and, in consequence, it is also characterized by one or more peculiar types of crystal forms having either one half or one quarterof the faces belonging to the form having the same symbol in the holosymmetric (holohedral) class : hence these classes and the forms belonging to them were formerly called respectively hemihedrul aud tetartohedrul, or in general merohedral. These terms are now but little used. The symmetry elements characteristic of each of the thirty-two symmetry classes are discussed in modern treatises on crystallography. In the following list the usual names of the classes are given, the classes being arranged, in general, in rising order, as to symmetry. Triclinic system. 1.
