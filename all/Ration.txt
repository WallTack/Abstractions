A scientific ration contains in due proportion and amount the essential food ingredients, namely, fats and carbohydrates, which supply heat and working-energy (heat-producers); and protein (nitrogenous substances), which provides for the upbuilding and repair of tissues (flesh-producers). The absolute and relative amounts required are learned from experience and vary with the animal and its occupation. See feeding standard, nutritive ratio, and phrases below. A ration is governed not by the actual amount of the ingredients, but by the amount digestible (often much less than the whole), this being determined by experiments the results of which are published in tables. Feeding standards are not now much used for precise calculation.</span> </li>
