						We must thus compare the typical relaxation time in the RM fast-ﬂow regime τ (l) ∼ τc (ξ/lc )z (l/ξ )zFF , for ξ &lt; l ≤ LM , with the “time of ﬂight” τM = M /v , being zFF ≡ zTH = 2 the dynamical exponent of the fast-ﬂow RM class, z the dynamical exponent of the critical RM regime, and τc a microscopic time.
