						Actually, the occurrence of a sharp peak in the velocity distribution of a cloud of 87Rb atoms, released from a magnetic trap, was the ﬁrst evidence of Bose-Einstein condensations in these cold gases , and the transition temperature was found to be very close to the value predicted by Eq. (2).

						The sharpness of the spectrum is already a signature that the cold matrix around the molecule is superﬂuid. A nonsuperﬂuid matrix would smear the spectrum so much that it could not be resolved; a demonstration of this effect has been given in Ref. by replacing 4He (super) with a variable amount of 3He (normal).
