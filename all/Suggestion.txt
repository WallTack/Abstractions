										<div class="usage">
						This is to be compared with observations of rotation curves, which suggest according to the virial theorem that the amount of matter in galactic haloes Ωhalo ≃ 0.1. A similar abundance of baryonic matters is suggested 130 by observations of rich clusters of galaxies.

						The Strange Spin of the Nucleon
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						It suggests that cold dark matter has much of the truth, but perhaps not all of it , and has led to the suggestion that something needs to be added to the simplest cold dark matter theory.

						Inflation: From Theory to Observation and Back
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						For example, it is suggested that the smallness of ǫ arises from the ratio Mstr /MP l , or in the context of anomalous U(1) horizontal symmetries it is suggested that the ratio could be &lt; θ &gt; /Mpl where θ is a dynamical ﬁeld which develops a VEV below the string scale.

						SUSY/SUGRA/String Phenomenology
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						Can this be reconciled with Gunn-Peterson observations at z ≈ 4.7 that suggest reionization in hydrogen? Theoretical models of the QSO luminosity function and IGM opacity suggest that the IGM should be reionized in He II at z ≥ 3.3.

						Their data support a pole dominance picture and an asymptotic behaviour A/Q2 suggested by theory (Lepage (1979)) but not with the suggested coeﬃcient A.

										<div class="usage">
						If a higher estimate of Tc was employed in the ﬁt, ﬁnite-size scaling of the data was suggestive of a ﬁrstorder transition, while if a lower estimate of Tc was employed, it was suggestive of a continuous transition with the exponents close to the previous works .

						To reconcile the cluster value of fb ≈ 0.1 with the LSB galaxy value of fb ≈ 0.02 suggested in Figure 3, one might suggest that not all of the baryons have been incorporated into the disk. 
					</div>

						How Galaxies Don't Form
					</div>
										<div class="usage">
						The power-law shape of the spectra suggests that energy input to the turbulence is on yet larger scales. A probable energy source on these larger scales is the galactic differential rotation, as also suggested by numerical simulations of Wada &amp; Norman (1999).
