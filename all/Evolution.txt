										The lemur of Madagascar is one of very few of the human species' ancestors that has survived unchanged down the long corridors of evolution. Having developed after the first primates, it is classified as a prosimian, meaning "before monkey," and is one of the ancestors common to both monkeys and men.

										When Charles Darwin published his theory on human evolution in The Descent of Man in 1871, not a single fossil that was known to be pre-human had been found to back up his ideas. Although his theory was later proved to be true, it was formulated entirely without physical evidence and based almost completely on speculation.

As a fact, this evolution is not open to question. As a doctrine or theory of generation, it is susceptible of different interpretations. In one view, the germ actually preëxists in one or the other parent, and is simply unfolded or expanded, but not actually formed, in the act of procreation. (See ovulist, spermatist.) This view is now generally abandoned, the current opinion being that each parent furnishes materials for or the substance of the germ, whose evolution results from the union of such elements. See epigenesis.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">evolution</span> <span class="exp">The fact or the doctrine of the derivation or descent, with modification, of all existing species, genera, orders, classes, etc., of animals and plants, from a few simple forms of life, if not from one; the doctrine of derivation; evolutionism. (See Darwinism.) In this sense, evolution is opposed to creationism, or the view that all living things have been created at some time substantially as they now exist. Modern evolutionary theories, however, are less concerned with the problem of the origination of life than with questions of the ways and means by which living organisms have assumed their actual characters or forms. Phylogenetic evolution insists upon the direct derivation of all forms of life from other antecedent forms, in no other way than as, in ontogeny, offspring are derived from parents, and consequently grades all actual affinities according to propinquity or remoteness of genetic succession. It presumes that, as a rule, such derivation or descent, with modification, is from the more simple to the more complex forms, from low to high in organization, and from the more generalized to the more specialized in structure and function; but it also recognizes retrograde development, degeneration or degradation. The doctrine is now accepted by most biologists as a conception which most nearly coincides with the ascertained facts in the case, and which best explains observed facts, though it is held with many shades of individual opinion in this or that particular. See natural selection, under selection.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">evolution</span> <span class="exp">In general, the passage from unorganized simplicity to organized complexity (that is, to a nicer and more elaborate arrangement for reaching definite ends), this process being regarded as of the nature of a growth. Thus, the development of planetary bodies from nebular or gaseous matter, and the history of the development of an individual plant or animal, or of society, are examples of evolution.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">evolution</span> <span class="exp">Continuous succession; serial development.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">evolution</span> <span class="exp">In mathematics: In geometry, the unfolding or opening of a curve, and making it describe an evolvent. The equable evolution of the periphery of a circle or other curve is such a gradual approach of the circumference to straightness that its parts do not concur and equally evolve or unbend, so that the same line becomes successively a smaller are of a reciprocally greater circle, till at last they change into a straight line.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">evolution</span> <span class="exp">The extraction of roots from powers: the reverse of involution (which see).</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">evolution</span> <span class="exp">A turning or shifting movement; a passing back and forth; change and interchange of position, especially for the working out of a purpose or a plan; specifically, the movement of troops or ships of war in wheeling, countermarching, manœuvering, etc., for disposition in order of battle or in line on parade: generally in the plural, to express the whole series of movements.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">evolution</span> <span class="exp">That which is evolved; a product; an outgrowth.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">evolution</span> <span class="exp">In ancestral development or phylogeny, the doctrine or opinion that the specific constitution or architecture which a germ-cell is held to possess at the beginning of its development, and to which the organization of the being that is generated from it is attributed, preexisted in the germ-cells of preceding generations. In the extreme form in which it was held by the embryologists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it is the doctrine that since individual development is and always has been the unfolding of preexisting structure, each successive organism has existed, as such, from the beginning, in the germ-cells of its first ancestor, and in those of all successive ancestors, so that it is not the actual modem organism, but only its visibility or perceptibility by sense that is new. The modifications of this doctrine by more modern embryologists, who have sought to make it consistent with the progress of biological science, are too subtile and refined for concise statement.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">evolution</span> <span class="exp">In biology, the doctrine or opinion, accepted as an established truth by all recent biologists, that all living beings have come into existence, in course of nature, by uninterrupted descent, without break of continuity, from a few ancient and simple forms of life, or from one.</span> </li>
