The slowness of their motions on the ground is the necessary consequence of their disproportioned structure, and particularly of the fact that the feet exhibit a conformation resembling that of clubfoot in man—a disposition of the carpal and tarsal joints highly useful in climbing. Sloths live on trees, and never remove from one until they have stripped it of every leaf. They are helpless when on the ground, and seem at home only on trees, suspended beneath the branches, along which they are sometimes observed to travel from tree to tree with considerable celerity. The female produces a single young one at a birth, which she carries about with her until it is able to climb. Sloths are confined to the wooded regions of tropical America, extending northward into Mexico. At least 12 species are described, but the true number is fewer. All have three toes on the hind feet, but some have only two on the fore feet, whence the obvious distinction of three-toed and two-toed sloths (a distinction even more strongly marked in the anatomy of these animals) warranted a division of the family into bradypods (Bradypodinæ) and cholopodines (Cholopodinæ). Most sloths belong to the former group, and these have the general name ai. The best-known of these is the collared three-toed sloth, Bradypus tridactylus or torquatus, with a sort of mane. The unau or two-toed sloth, Cholopus didactylus, inhabits Brazil; it is entirely covered with long coarse woolly hair. (See cut under Cholopus.) A second and quite distinct species of this genus, C. hoffmanni, inhabits Central America. (See Tardigrada, 1.) The name is apparently a translation of the Portuguese word preguiça (Latin pigritia), slowness, slothfulness.
