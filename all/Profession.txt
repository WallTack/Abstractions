Formerly theology, law, and medicine were specifically known as the professions; but, as the applications of science and learning are extended to other departments of affairs, other vocations also receive the name. The word implies professed attainments in special knowledge, as distinguished from mere skill; a practical dealing with affairs, as distinguished from mere study or investigation; and an application of such knowledge to uses for others as a vocation, as distinguished from its pursuit for one's own purposes. In professions strictly so called a preliminary examination as to qualifications is usually demanded by law or usage, and a license or other official authority founded thereon required. In law the significance of the word has been contested under statutes imposing taxes on persons pursuing any “occupation, trade, or profession,” and under statutes authorizing arrest in civil actions for misconduct in a “professional employment”; and it has been, in the former use, held clearly to include the vocation of an attorney, and upon the same principle would doubtless include physicians, unless the mention of trade, etc., in the same clause of the statute be ground for interpreting the statute as relating only to business vocations. Professional employment, in statutes allowing arrest, is regarded as not including a private agency like that of a factor or a real-estate broker, which can be taken up and laid down at pleasure.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">profession</span> <span class="exp">The collective body of persons engaged in a calling: as, practices disgraceful to the profession; to be at the head of one's profession.</span> </li><li><span class="tSpeech">n</span> <span class="term">profession</span> <span class="exp">The act by which a novice enters into a religious order and takes its vows.
