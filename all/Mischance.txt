							Julian.<br>
One thing, and I have done: lest a mischance<br>
Befall us, though I do not fear it much—<br>
have been very secret—is that boat<br>
I had before I left, in sailing trim?
							<div class="poet">"Within and Without: Part II: A Dramatic Poem" by <span>George MacDonald</span></div>
						</div>
											<div class="poemQuote">
							A heart where dread was never so impress'd,<br>
To hide the thought that might the truth advance;<br>
In neither fortune loft, nor yet repress'd,<br>
To swell in wealth, or yield unto mischance.
							<div class="poet">"Of The Death Of Sir Thomas Wyatt The Elder" by <span>Henry Howard </span></div>
						</div>
											<div class="poemQuote">
							To those, that must a distant journey take,<br>
Better is pray'r than wine, the thirst to slake,<br>
Better than forts, to ward the light'ning's glance,<br>
Better than ought, to guard against mischance.
							<div class="poet">"Advice, To The Traveller" by <span>Rees Prichard</span></div>
						</div>
											<div class="poemQuote">
							The wasting night now wears away;<br>
The youth's fond mother at his stay,<br>
To fear maternal yields;<br>
And doubting of some dire mischance,<br>
She hurries, ere the morn's advance,<br>
To seek him in the fields.
							<div class="poet">"The Grateful Snake" by <span>William Hayley</span></div>
						</div>
											<div class="poemQuote">
							He kiss'd her thrice, with his lips of fire:<br>
"Appease, O mother, appease thine ire;<br>
Ne'er wish me any mischance to know,<br>
For thou canst not tell how far I may go."<br>
Look out, look out, Svend Vonved.
							<div class="poet">"Svend Vonved" by <span>George Borrow</span></div>

											<div class="poemQuote">
							A prince, a leader born,<br>
His dark eye flashed with scorn,<br>
He said: "My father, listen, there's rumours from afar,<br>
Of mishaps, and mistakes,<br>
Of disasters on the lakes,<br>
My father need not hide the mischances of the war.
